A collection of python scripts to simulate Muller's ratchet by  R.A. Neher and 
B.I. Shraiman, released as supplementary information to the publication

"Fluctuations of fitness distributions and the rate of  Muller's ratchet" 

in Genetics xxxx. 

All of these python scripts make use of scipy, numpy and the plotting environment
matplotlib and the bundle pylab which is freely available at http://www.scipy.org
Convenient free binary installers are available from enthought.com.


SIMULATING THE MODEL
The main routines needed for the evolution of the population are contained in
the file "evolve_methods.py", which is interfaced by the script "ratchet.py".
The latter accepts a host of command line arguments which allow the user to
specify the population parameters, the runtime, the output directory and the 
type of simulation that is being run. These options are

usage: ratchet.py [-h] [--pop POP] [--lam LAM] [--sel SEL] [--sigma SIGMA]
                  [--mu MU] [--Trun TRUN] [--Ttraj TTRAJ] [--Teq TEQ]
                  [--poisson POISSON] [--speed] [--traj] [--dt DT]
                  [--outdir OUTDIR]

Simulate a deleterious mutation selection balance and determine the rate of
Muller's ratchet

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --pop POP          Population size (N)
  --lam LAM          Lambda (u/s)
  --sel SEL          Selection strength (s)
  --sigma SIGMA      Sigma (sqrt(u*s))
  --mu MU            Mutation rate u
  --Trun TRUN        Time over which the ratchet rate is measured in
                     generations
  --Ttraj TTRAJ      Length of trajectory in generations
  --Teq TEQ          Equilibration time in generations
  --poisson POISSON  Poisson [1] sampling vs multinomial [0]
  --speed            Measure speed
  --traj             Store trajectory
  --dt DT            time increments of trajectory
  --outdir OUTDIR    Directory into which output is directed


FINDING THE MOST LIKELY PATH TO EXTINCTION
The shape of the optimal path is only a function of lambda = u/s. This parameter,
along with an optional argument specifying the output directory, are the only arguments
to the program optimize_path.py. 

usage: optimize_path.py [-h] [--lam LAM] [--outdir OUTDIR]

Find the optimal path to extinction that minimizes the path integral action

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --lam LAM        parameter lambda, ratio of mutation rate to mutation effect
  --outdir OUTDIR  directory into which output files are saved



ANALYSIS AND PLOTTING
Additional analysis scripts are also provided, along with the data necessary to 
generate the plots of the paper. These scripts are best run using the interactive
python console ipython.

plot_ratchet_rate.py
reads in the numerically determined ratchet rates and produces the figures that 
compare the simulation data to the results of the paper.

plot_correlation_functions.py
reads in trajectories of the size of the fittest class and the mean fitness, calculates
their correlation functions and compares them the to the analytic expressions presented in 
the paper. The trajectory data is hundreds of MB and therefore not included in the online
supplement, but available on request.

correlation_functions.py 
contains the definitions of the correlation function
calculated in the paper and routines for numerical evaluation of the integrals.
