abstract = {We propose a phenomenological description for the effect of a weak noise on the position of a front described by the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov equation or any other traveling-wave equation in the same class. Our scenario is based on four hypotheses on the relevant mechanism for the diffusion of the front. Our parameter-free analytical predictions for the velocity of the front, its diffusion constant and higher cumulants of its position agree with numerical simulations.},

title = {Genealogies in simple models of evolution},
abstract = { We review the statistical properties of the genealogies of a few models of evolution. In the asexual case, selection leads to coalescence times which grow logarithmically with the size of the population in contrast with the linear growth of the neutral case. Moreover for a whole class of models, the statistics of the genealogies are those of the Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescent rather than the Kingman coalescent in the neutral case. For sexual reproduction, the time to reach the first common ancestors to the whole population and the time for all individuals to have all their ancestors in common are also logarithmic in the neutral case, as predicted by Chang []. We discuss how these times are modified in a simple way of introducing selection. },

title = {Fluctuations of Fitness Distributions and the Rate of Muller's Ratchet},
abstract = {The accumulation of deleterious mutations is driven by rare fluctuations which lead to the loss of all mutation free individuals, a process known as Muller's ratchet. Even though Muller's ratchet is a paradigmatic process in population genetics, a quantitative understanding of its rate is still lacking. The difficulty lies in the nontrivial nature of fluctuations in the fitness distribution which control the rate of extinction of the fittest genotype. We address this problem using the simple but classic model of mutation selection balance with deleterious mutations all having the same effect on fitness. We show analytically how fluctuations among the fittest individuals propagate to individuals of lower fitness and have a dramatically amplified effects on the bulk of the population at a later time. If a reduction in the size of the fittest class reduces the mean fitness only after a delay, selection opposing this reduction is also delayed. This delayed restoring force speeds up Muller's ratchet. We show how the delayed response can be accounted for using a path integral formulation of the stochastic dynamics and provide an expression for the rate of the ratchet that is accurate across a broad range of parameters.},

title = {Estimating the Strength of Selective Sweeps from DeepPopulation Diversity Data},
abstract = {Selective sweeps are typically associated with a local reduction of genetic diversity around the adaptive site. However, selective sweeps can also quickly carry neutral mutations to observable population frequencies if they arise early in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay between mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a characteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation that depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection coefficient of the sweep. Based on this result, we develop an estimator for the selection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the novel variation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on preexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination. Compared with standard approaches that infer selection coefficients from the size of dips in genetic diversity around the adaptive site, our estimator requires much shorter sequences but sampled at high population depth in order to capture low-frequency variants; given such data, it consistently outperforms standard approaches. We investigate analytically and numerically how the accuracy of our estimator is affected by the decay of the sweep pattern over time as a consequence of random genetic drift and discuss potential effects of recombination, soft sweeps, and demography. As an example for its use, we apply our estimator to deep sequencing data from HIV populations.},

title = {Dynamic Mutation Selection Balance as an Evolutionary Attractor},
abstract = {The vast majority of mutations are deleterious, and are eliminated by purifying selection. Yet in finite asexual populations, purifying selection cannot completely prevent the accumulation of deleterious mutations due to Muller's ratchet: once lost by stochastic drift, the most-fit class of genotypes is lost forever. If deleterious mutations are weakly selected, Muller's ratchet can lead to a rapid degradation of population fitness. Evidently, the long term stability of an asexual population requires an in ux of beneficial mutations that continuously compensate for the accumulation of the weakly deleterious ones. Hence any stable evolutionary state of a population in a static environment must involve a dynamic mutation-selection balance, where accumulation of deleterious mutations is on average offset by the in ux of beneficial mutations. We argue that such a state can exist for any population size N and mutation rate U, and calculate the fraction of beneficial mutations, ε, that maintains the balanced state. We find that a surprisingly low ε suffices to achieve stability, even in small populations in the face of high mutation rates and weak selection, maintaining a well adaptive population in spite of Muller's ratchet. This may explain the maintenance of mitochondria and other asexual genomes.},

abstract = { We describe a representation of the Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescent in terms of the cutting of random recursive trees. Using this representation, we prove results concerning the final collision of the coalescent restricted to [n]: we show that the distribution of the number of blocks involved in the final collision converges as n tends to infinity, and obtain a scaling law for the sizes of these blocks. We also consider the discrete-time Markov chain giving the number of blocks after each collision of the coalescent restricted to [n]; we show that the transition probabilities of the time-reversal of this Markov chain have limits as n tends to infinity. These results can be interpreted as describing a ``post-gelation'' phase of the Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescent, in which a giant cluster containing almost all of the mass has already formed and the remaining small blocks are being absorbed. },

journal = {Theoretical population biology},
title = {Mutation-selection balance: ancestry, load, and maximum principle},
abstract = {We analyze the equilibrium behavior of deterministic haploid mutation-selection models. To this end, both the forward and the time-reversed evolution processes are considered. The stationary state of the latter is called the ancestral distribution, which turns out as a key for the study of mutation-selection balance. We find that the ancestral genotype frequencies determine the sensitivity of the equilibrium mean fitness to changes in the corresponding fitness values and discuss implications for the evolution of mutational robustness. We further show that the difference between the ancestral and the population mean fitness, termed mutational loss, provides a measure for the sensitivity of the equilibrium mean fitness to changes in the mutation rate. The interrelation of the loss and the mutation load is discussed. For a class of models in which the number of mutations in an individual is taken as the trait value, and fitness is a function of the trait, we use the ancestor formulation to derive a simple maximum principle, from which the mean and variance of fitness and the trait may be derived; the results are exact for a number of limiting cases, and otherwise yield approximations which are accurate for a wide range of parameters. These results are applied to threshold phenomena caused by the interplay of selection and mutation (known as error thresholds). They lead to a clarification of concepts, as well as criteria for the existence of error thresholds.},

title = {The role of evolutionary intermediates in the host adaptation of canine parvovirus},
abstract = {The adaptation of viruses to new hosts is a poorly understood process likely involving a variety of viral structures and functions that allow efficient replication and spread. Canine parvovirus (CPV) emerged in the late 1970s as a host-range variant of a virus related to feline panleukopenia virus (FPV). Within a few years of its emergence in dogs, there was a worldwide replacement of the initial virus strain (CPV type 2) by a variant (CPV type 2a) characterized by four amino acid differences in the capsid protein. However, the evolutionary processes that underlie the acquisition of these four mutations, as well as their effects on viral fitness, both singly and in combination, are still uncertain. Using a comprehensive experimental analysis of multiple intermediate mutational combinations, we show that these four capsid mutations act in concert to alter antigenicity, cell receptor binding, and relative in vitro growth in feline cells. Hence, host adaptation involved complex interactions among both surface-exposed and buried capsid mutations that together altered cell infection and immune escape properties of the viruses. Notably, most intermediate viral genotypes containing different combinations of the four key amino acids possessed markedly lower fitness than the wild-type viruses.},

abstract = {Networks of interacting biomolecules carry out many essential functions in living cells, but the 'design principles' underlying the functioning of such intracellular networks remain poorly understood, despite intensive efforts including quantitative analysis of relatively simple systems. Here we present a complementary approach to this problem: the design and construction of a synthetic network to implement a particular function. We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such 'rational network design may lead both to the engineering of new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.},

title = {Role of multiple hosts in the cross-species transmission and emergence of a pandemic parvovirus},
abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms of cross-species virus transmission is critical to anticipating emerging infectious diseases. Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) emerged as a variant of a feline parvovirus when it acquired mutations that allowed binding to the canine transferrin receptor type 1 (TfR). However, CPV-2 was soon replaced by a variant virus (CPV-2a) that differed in antigenicity and receptor binding. Here we show that the emergence of CPV involved an additional host range variant virus that has circulated undetected in raccoons for at least 24 years, with transfers to and from dogs. Raccoon virus capsids showed little binding to the canine TfR, showed little infection of canine cells, and had altered antigenic structures. Remarkably, in capsid protein (VP2) phylogenies, most raccoon viruses fell as evolutionary intermediates between the CPV-2 and CPV-2a strains, suggesting that passage through raccoons assisted in the evolution of CPV-2a. This highlights the potential role of alternative hosts in viral emergence.},

title = {Origin of irreversibility of cell cycle start in budding yeast},
abstract = {Budding yeast cells irreversibly commit to a new division cycle at a regulatory transition called Start. This essential decision-making step involves the activation of the SBF/MBF transcription factors. SBF/MBF promote expression of the G1 cyclins encoded by CLN1 and CLN2. Cln1,2 can activate their own expression by inactivating the Whi5 repressor of SBF/MBF. The resulting transcriptional positive feedback provides an appealing, but as yet unproven, candidate for generating irreversibility of Start. Here, we investigate the logic of the Start regulatory module by quantitative single-cell time-lapse microscopy, using strains in which expression of key regulators is efficiently controlled by changes of inducers in a microfluidic chamber. We show that Start activation is ultrasensitive to G1 cyclin. In the absence of CLN1,2-dependent positive feedback, we observe that Start transit is reversible, due to reactivation of the Whi5 transcriptional repressor. Introduction of the positive feedback loop makes Whi5 inactivation and Start activation irreversible, which therefore guarantees unidirectional entry into S phase. A simple mathematical model to describe G1 cyclin turn on at Start, entirely constrained by empirically measured parameters, shows that the experimentally measured ultrasensitivity and transcriptional positive feedback are necessary and sufficient dynamical characteristics to make the Start transition a bistable and irreversible switch. Our study thus demonstrates that Start irreversibility is a property that arises from the architecture of the system (Whi5/SBF/Cln2 loop), rather than the consequence of the regulation of a single component (e.g., irreversible protein degradation).},

title = {An excitable gene regulatory circuit induces transient cellular differentiation},
abstract = {Certain types of cellular differentiation are probabilistic and transient. In such systems individual cells can switch to an alternative state and, after some time, switch back again. In Bacillus subtilis, competence is an example of such a transiently differentiated state associated with the capability for DNA uptake from the environment. Individual genes and proteins underlying differentiation into the competent state have been identified, but it has been unclear how these genes interact dynamically in individual cells to control both spontaneous entry into competence and return to vegetative growth. Here we show that this behaviour can be understood in terms of excitability in the underlying genetic circuit. Using quantitative fluorescence time-lapse microscopy, we directly observed the activities of multiple circuit components simultaneously in individual cells, and analysed the resulting data in terms of a mathematical model. We find that an excitable core module containing positive and negative feedback loops can explain both entry into, and exit from, the competent state. We further tested this model by analysing initiation in sister cells, and by re-engineering the gene circuit to specifically block exit. Excitable dynamics driven by noise naturally generate stochastic and transient responses, thereby providing an ideal mechanism for competence regulation.},

title = {Cross-sectional detection of acute HIV infection: timing of transmission, inflammation and antiretroviral therapy},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute HIV infection (AHI) is a critical phase of infection when irreparable damage to the immune system occurs and subjects are very infectious. We studied subjects with AHI prospectively to develop better treatment and public health interventions.

METHODS: Cross-sectional screening was employed to detect HIV RNA positive, antibody negative subjects. Date of HIV acquisition was estimated from clinical history and correlated with sequence diversity assessed by single genome amplification (SGA). Twenty-two cytokines/chemokines were measured from enrollment through week 24.

RESULTS: Thirty-seven AHI subjects were studied. In 7 participants with limited exposure windows, the median exposure to HIV occurred 14 days before symptom onset. Lack of viral sequence diversification confirmed the short duration of infection. Transmission dates estimated by SGA/sequencing using molecular clock models correlated with transmission dates estimated by symptom onset in individuals infected with single HIV variants (mean of 28 versus 33 days). Only 10 of 22 cytokines/chemokines were significantly elevated among AHI participants at enrollment compared to uninfected controls, and only 4 participants remained seronegative at enrollment.

DISCUSSION: The results emphasize the difficulty in recruiting subjects early in AHI. Viral sequence diversity proved accurate in estimating time of infection. Regardless of aggressive screening, peak viremia and inflammation occurred before enrollment and potential intervention. Given the personal and public health importance, improved AHI detection is urgently needed.},

abstract = {The death of CD4(+) CCR5(+) T cells is a hallmark of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We studied the plasma levels of cell death mediators and products--tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), Fas ligand, TNF receptor type 2 (TNFR-2), and plasma microparticles--during the earliest stages of infection following HIV type 1 (HIV-1) transmission in plasma samples from U.S. plasma donors. Significant plasma TRAIL level elevations occurred a mean of 7.2 days before the peak of plasma viral load (VL), while TNFR-2, Fas ligand, and microparticle level elevations occurred concurrently with maximum VL. Microparticles had been previously shown to mediate immunosuppressive effects on T cells and macrophages. We found that T-cell apoptotic microparticles also potently suppressed in vitro immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA antibody production by memory B cells. Thus, release of TRAIL during the onset of plasma viremia (i.e., the eclipse phase) in HIV-1 transmission may initiate or amplify early HIV-1-induced cell death. The window of opportunity for a HIV-1 vaccine is from the time of HIV-1 transmission until establishment of the latently infected CD4(+) T cells. Release of products of cell death and subsequent immunosuppression following HIV-1 transmission could potentially narrow the window of opportunity during which a vaccine is able to extinguish HIV-1 infection and could place severe constraints on the amount of time available for the immune system to respond to the transmitted virus.},

title = {The dynamics of HIV-1 adaptation in early infection},
abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) undergoes a severe population bottleneck during sexual transmission and yet adapts extremely rapidly to the earliest immune responses. The bottleneck has been inferred to typically consist of a single genome, and typically eight amino acid mutations in viral proteins spread to fixation by the end of the early chronic phase of infection in response to selection by CD8(+) T cells. Stochastic simulation was used to examine the effects of the transmission bottleneck and of potential interference among spreading immune-escape mutations on the adaptive dynamics of the virus in early infection. If major viral population genetic parameters are assigned realistic values that permit rapid adaptive evolution, then a bottleneck of a single genome is not inconsistent with the observed pattern of adaptive fixations. One requirement is strong selection by CD8(+) T cells that decreases over time. Such selection may reduce effective population sizes at linked loci through genetic hitchhiking. However, this effect is predicted to be minor in early infection because the transmission bottleneck reduces the effective population size to such an extent that the resulting strong selection and weak mutation cause beneficial mutations to fix sequentially and thus avoid interference.},

title = {Bounds on the minimum number of recombination events in a sample history},
abstract = {Recombination is an important evolutionary factor in many organisms, including humans, and understanding its effects is an important task facing geneticists. Detecting past recombination events is thus important; this article introduces statistics that give a lower bound on the number of recombination events in the history of a sample, on the basis of the patterns of variation in the sample DNA. Such lower bounds are appropriate, since many recombination events in the history are typically undetectable, so the true number of historical recombinations is unobtainable. The statistics can be calculated quickly by computer and improve upon the earlier bound of Hudson and Kaplan 1985. A method is developed to combine bounds on local regions in the data to produce more powerful improved bounds. The method is flexible to different models of recombination occurrence. The approach gives recombination event bounds between all pairs of sites, to help identify regions with more detectable recombinations, and these bounds can be viewed graphically. Under coalescent simulations, there is a substantial improvement over the earlier method (of up to a factor of 2) in the expected number of recombination events detected by one of the new minima, across a wide range of parameter values. The method is applied to data from a region within the lipoprotein lipase gene and the amount of detected recombination is substantially increased. Further, there is strong clustering of detected recombination events in an area near the center of the region. A program implementing these statistics, which was used for this article, is available from http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/mathgen/programs.html.},

We introduce a simplification of the coalescent process in which coalescence between lineages with no overlapping ancestral material is banned. The resulting process has a simple Markovian structure when generating genealogies sequentially along a sequence, yet has very similar properties to the full model, both in terms of describing patterns of genetic variation and as the basis for statistical inference.},

abstract = {Current routine genotyping methods typically do not provide haplotype information, which is essential for many analyses of fine-scale molecular-genetics data. Haplotypes can be obtained, at considerable cost, experimentally or (partially) through genotyping of additional family members. Alternatively, a statistical method can be used to infer phase and to reconstruct haplotypes. We present a new statistical method, applicable to genotype data at linked loci from a population sample, that improves substantially on current algorithms; often, error rates are reduced by > 50%, relative to its nearest competitor. Furthermore, our algorithm performs well in absolute terms, suggesting that reconstructing haplotypes experimentally or by genotyping additional family members may be an inefficient use of resources.},

title = {Generalized population models and the nature of genetic drift},
abstract = {The Wright-Fisher model of allele dynamics forms the basis for most theoretical and applied research in population genetics. Our understanding of genetic drift, and its role in suppressing the deterministic forces of Darwinian selection has relied on the specific form of sampling inherent to the Wright-Fisher model and its diffusion limit. Here we introduce and analyze a broad class of forward-time population models that share the same mean and variance as the Wright-Fisher model, but may otherwise differ. The proposed class unifies and further generalizes a number of population-genetic processes of recent interest, including the Λ and Cannings processes. Even though these models all have the same variance effective population size, they encode a rich diversity of alternative forms of genetic drift, with significant consequences for allele dynamics. We characterize in detail the behavior of standard population-genetic quantities across this family of generalized models. Some quantities, such as heterozygosity, remain unchanged; but others, such as neutral absorption times and fixation probabilities under selection, deviate by orders of magnitude from the Wright-Fisher model. We show that generalized population models can produce startling phenomena that differ qualitatively from classical behavior - such as assured fixation of a new mutant despite the presence of genetic drift. We derive the forward-time continuum limits of the generalized processes, analogous to Kimura's diffusion limit of the Wright-Fisher process, and we discuss their relationships to the Kingman and non-Kingman coalescents. Finally, we demonstrate that some non-diffusive, generalized models are more likely, in certain respects, than the Wright-Fisher model itself, given empirical data from Drosophila populations.},

title = {Direct estimation of per nucleotide and genomic deleterious mutation rates in Drosophila},
abstract = {Spontaneous mutations are the source of genetic variation required for evolutionary change, and are therefore important for many aspects of evolutionary biology. For example, the divergence between taxa at neutrally evolving sites in the genome is proportional to the per nucleotide mutation rate, u (ref. 1), and this can be used to date speciation events by assuming a molecular clock. The overall rate of occurrence of deleterious mutations in the genome each generation (U) appears in theories of nucleotide divergence and polymorphism, the evolution of sex and recombination, and the evolutionary consequences of inbreeding. However, estimates of U based on changes in allozymes or DNA sequences and fitness traits are discordant. Here we directly estimate u in Drosophila melanogaster by scanning 20 million bases of DNA from three sets of mutation accumulation lines by using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. From 37 mutation events that we detected, we obtained a mean estimate for u of 8.4 x 10(-9) per generation. Moreover, we detected significant heterogeneity in u among the three mutation-accumulation-line genotypes. By multiplying u by an estimate of the fraction of mutations that are deleterious in natural populations of Drosophila, we estimate that U is 1.2 per diploid genome. This high rate suggests that selection against deleterious mutations may have a key role in explaining patterns of genetic variation in the genome, and help to maintain recombination and sexual reproduction.},

abstract = {The friction coefficient of a particle can depend on its position, as it does when the particle is near a wall. We formulate the dynamics of particles with such state-dependent friction coefficients in terms of a general Langevin equation with multiplicative noise, whose evaluation requires the introduction of specific rules. Two common conventions, the Ito and the Stratonovich, provide alternative rules for evaluation of the noise, but other conventions are possible. We show that the requirement that a particle's distribution function approach the Boltzmann distribution at long times dictates that a drift term must be added to the Langevin equation. This drift term is proportional to the derivative of the diffusion coefficient times a factor that depends on the convention used to define the multiplicative noise. We explore the consequences of this result in a number of examples with spatially varying diffusion coefficients. We also derive a path integral representation for arbitrary interpretation of the noise, and use it in a perturbative study of correlations in a simple system.},

abstract = {Compared to a neutral model, purifying selection distorts the structure of genealogies and hence alters the patterns of sampled genetic variation. Although these distortions may be common in nature, our understanding of how we expect purifying selection to affect patterns of molecular variation remains incomplete. Genealogical approaches such as coalescent theory have proven difficult to generalize to situations involving selection at many linked sites, unless selection pressures are extremely strong. Here, we introduce an effective coalescent theory (a "fitness-class coalescent") to describe the structure of genealogies in the presence of purifying selection at many linked sites. We use this effective theory to calculate several simple statistics describing the expected patterns of variation in sequence data, both at the sites under selection and at linked neutral sites. Our analysis combines a description of the allele frequency spectrum in the presence of purifying selection with the structured coalescent approach of Kaplan et al. (1988), to trace the ancestry of individuals through the distribution of fitnesses within the population. We also derive our results using a more direct extension of the structured coalescent approach of Hudson and Kaplan (1994). We find that purifying selection leads to patterns of genetic variation that are related but not identical to a neutrally evolving population in which population size has varied in a specific way in the past.},

title = {The structure of allelic diversity in the presence of purifying selection},
abstract = {In the absence of selection, the structure of equilibrium allelic diversity is described by the elegant sampling formula of Ewens. This formula has helped to shape our expectations of empirical patterns of molecular variation. Along with coalescent theory, it provides statistical techniques for rejecting the null model of neutrality. However, we still do not fully understand the statistics of the allelic diversity expected in the presence of natural selection. Earlier work has described the effects of strongly deleterious mutations linked to many neutral sites, and allelic variation in models where offspring fitness is unrelated to parental fitness, but it has proven difficult to understand allelic diversity in the presence of purifying selection at many linked sites. Here, we study the population genetics of infinitely many perfectly linked sites, some neutral and some deleterious. Our approach is based on studying the lineage structure within each class of individuals of similar fitness in the deleterious mutation-selection balance. Consistent with previous observations, we find that for moderate and weak selection pressures, the patterns of allelic diversity cannot be described by a neutral model for any choice of the effective population site.

abstract = {In Escherichia coli crosstalk between DNA supercoiling, nucleoid-associated proteins and major RNA polymerase σ initiation factors regulates growth phase-dependent gene transcription. We show that the highly conserved spatial ordering of relevant genes along the chromosomal replichores largely corresponds both to their temporal expression patterns during growth and to an inferred gradient of DNA superhelical density from the origin to the terminus. Genes implicated in similar functions are related mainly in trans across the chromosomal replichores, whereas DNA-binding transcriptional regulators interact predominantly with targets in cis along the replichores. We also demonstrate that macrodomains (the individual structural partitions of the chromosome) are regulated differently. We infer that spatial and temporal variation of DNA superhelicity during the growth cycle coordinates oxygen and nutrient availability with global chromosome structure, thus providing a mechanistic insight into how the organization of a complete bacterial chromosome encodes a spatiotemporal program integrating DNA replication and global gene expression.},

abstract = {A new model for the evolution of reduced genetic activity of the Y sex chromosome is described. The model is based on the process of genetic hitchhiking. It is shown that the Y chromosome can gradually lose its genetic activity due to the fixation of deleterious mutations that are linked with other beneficial genes. Fixation of deleterious Y-linked mutations generates locus-specific selection for dosage tolerance and/or compensation. The hitchhiking effect is most pronounced when operating in combination with an alternative model, Muller's ratchet. It is shown, however, that the genetic hitchhiking mechanism can operate under conditions where Muller's ratchet is ineffective.},

abstract = {We expand on a previous study of fronts in finite particle number reaction-diffusion systems in the presence of a reaction rate gradient in the direction of motion of the front. We study the system via reaction-diffusion equations, using the expedient of a cutoff in the reaction rate below some critical density to capture the essential role of fluctuations in the system. For large density, the velocity is large, which allows for an approximate analytic treatment. We derive an analytic approximation for the dependence of the front velocity on bulk particle density, showing that the velocity indeed diverges in the infinite density limit. The form in which diffusion is implemented, namely nearest-neighbor hopping on a lattice, is seen to have an essential impact on the nature of the divergence.},

title = {Energy-dependent fitness: a quantitative model for the evolution of yeast transcription factor binding sites},
abstract = {We present a genomewide cross-species analysis of regulation for broad-acting transcription factors in yeast. Our model for binding site evolution is founded on biophysics: the binding energy between transcription factor and site is a quantitative phenotype of regulatory function, and selection is given by a fitness landscape that depends on this phenotype. The model quantifies conservation, as well as loss and gain, of functional binding sites in a coherent way. Its predictions are supported by direct cross-species comparison between four yeast species. We find ubiquitous compensatory mutations within functional sites, such that the energy phenotype and the function of a site evolve in a significantly more constrained way than does its sequence. We also find evidence for substantial evolution of regulatory function involving point mutations as well as sequence insertions and deletions within binding sites. Genes lose their regulatory link to a given transcription factor at a rate similar to the neutral point mutation rate, from which we infer a moderate average fitness advantage of functional over nonfunctional sites. In a wider context, this study provides an example of inference of selection acting on a quantitative molecular trait.},

title = {Active liquid-like behavior of nucleoli determines their size and shape in Xenopus laevis oocytes},
abstract = {For most intracellular structures with larger than molecular dimensions, little is known about the connection between underlying molecular activities and higher order organization such as size and shape. Here, we show that both the size and shape of the amphibian oocyte nucleolus ultimately arise because nucleoli behave as liquid-like droplets of RNA and protein, exhibiting characteristic viscous fluid dynamics even on timescales of < 1 min. We use these dynamics to determine an apparent nucleolar viscosity, and we show that this viscosity is ATP-dependent, suggesting a role for active processes in fluidizing internal contents. Nucleolar surface tension and fluidity cause their restructuring into spherical droplets upon imposed mechanical deformations. Nucleoli exhibit a broad distribution of sizes with a characteristic power law, which we show is a consequence of spontaneous coalescence events. These results have implications for the function of nucleoli in ribosome subunit processing and provide a physical link between activity within a macromolecular assembly and its physical properties on larger length scales.},

title = {Estimation of the initial viral growth rate and basic reproductive number during acute HIV-1 infection},
abstract = {During primary infection, the number of HIV-1 particles in plasma increases rapidly, reaches a peak, and then declines until it reaches a set point level. Understanding the kinetics of primary infection, and its effect on the establishment of chronic infection, is important in defining the early pathogenesis of HIV. We studied the viral dynamics of very early HIV-1 infection in 47 subjects identified through plasma donation screening. We calculated how fast the viral load increases and how variable this parameter is among individuals. We also estimated the basic reproductive ratio, the number of new infected cells generated by an infectious cell at the start of infection when target cells are not limiting. The initial viral doubling time had a median of 0.65 days with an interquartile range of 0.56 to 0.91 days. The median basic reproductive ratio was 8.0 with an interquartile range of 4.9 to 11. In 15 patients, we also observed the postpeak decay of plasma virus and found that the virus decay occurred at a median rate of 0.60 day(-1), corresponding to a half-life of 1.2 days. The median peak viral load was 5.8 log(10) HIV-1 RNA copies/ml, and it was reached 14 days after the virus was quantifiable with an assay, with a lower limit of detection of 50 copies/ml. These results characterize the early plasma viral dynamics in acute HIV infection better than it has been possible thus far. They also better define the challenge that the immune response (or therapeutic intervention) has to overcome to defeat HIV at this early stage.},

To address these issues we developed a technique to quantify and genetically characterize HIV-1 DNA from single infected cells in vivo. Analysis of peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells from nine patients revealed that the majority of infected cells contain only one copy of HIV-1 DNA, implying a limited potential for recombination in virus produced by these cells. The genetic similarity between HIV populations in CD4(+) T cells and plasma implies ongoing exchange between these compartments both early and late after infection.},

title = {Rare beneficial mutations can halt Muller's ratchet},
abstract = { The vast majority of mutations are deleterious, and are eliminated by purifying selection. Yet in finite asexual populations, purifying selection cannot completely prevent the accumulation of deleterious mutations due to Muller's ratchet: once lost by stochastic drift, the most-fit class of genotypes is lost forever. If deleterious mutations are weakly selected, Muller's ratchet turns into a mutational "meltdown" leading to a rapid degradation of population fitness. Evidently, the long term stability of an asexual population requires an influx of beneficial mutations that continuously compensate for the accumulation of the weakly deleterious ones. Here we propose that the stable evolutionary state of a population in a static environment is a dynamic mutation-selection balance, where accumulation of deleterious mutations is on average offset by the influx of beneficial mutations. We argue that this state exists for any population size N and mutation rate {\$}U{\$}. Assuming that beneficial and deleterious mutations have the same fitness effect s, we calculate the fraction of beneficial mutations, \epsilon, that maintains the balanced state. We find that a surprisingly low \epsilon suffices to maintain stability, even in small populations in the face of high mutation rates and weak selection. This may explain the maintenance of mitochondria and other asexual genomes, and has implications for the expected statistics of genetic diversity in these populations. },

abstract = {Loss of fitness due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations appears to be inevitable in small, obligately asexual populations, as these are incapable of reconstituting highly fit genotypes by recombination or back mutation. The cumulative buildup of such mutations is expected to lead to an eventual reduction in population size, and this facilitates the chance accumulation of future mutations. This synergistic interaction between population size reduction and mutation accumulation leads to an extinction process known as the mutational meltdown, and provides a powerful explanation for the rarity of obligate asexuality. We give an overview of the theory of the mutational meltdown, showing how the process depends on the demographic properties of a population, the properties of mutations, and the relationship between fitness and number of mutations incurred.},

abstract = {We consider the dynamics of a nonrecombining haploid population of finite size that accumulates deleterious mutations irreversibly. This ratchet-like process occurs at a finite speed in the absence of epistasis, but it has been suggested that synergistic epistasis can halt the ratchet. Using a diffusion theory, we find explicit analytical expressions for the typical time between successive clicks of the ratchet for both nonepistatic and epistatic fitness functions. Our calculations show that the interclick time is of a scaling form that in the absence of epistasis gives a speed that is determined by size of the least-loaded class and the selection coefficient. With synergistic interactions, the ratchet speed is found to approach zero rapidly for arbitrary epistasis. Our analytical results are in good agreement with the numerical simulations.},

title = {The advance of {Muller's} ratchet in a haploid asexual population: approximate solutions based on diffusion theory},
abstract = {Asexual populations experiencing random genetic drift can accumulate an increasing number of deleterious mutations, a process called Muller's ratchet. We present here diffusion approximations for the rate at which Muller's ratchet advances in asexual haploid populations. The most important parameter of this process is n0 = N e-U/s, where N is population size, U the genomic mutation rate and s the selection coefficient. In a very large population, n0 is the equilibrium size of the mutation-free class. We examined the case n0 > 1 and developed one approximation for intermediate values of N and s and one for large values of N and s. For intermediate values, the expected time at which the ratchet advances increases linearly with n0. For large values, the time increases in a more or less exponential fashion with n0. In addition to n0, s is also an important determinant of the speed of the ratchet. If N and s are intermediate and n0 is fixed, we find that increasing s accelerates the ratchet. In contrast, for a given n0, but large N and s, increasing s slows the ratchet. Except when s is small, results based on our approximations fit well those from computer simulations.},

Simulation results are presented to show that the approximation estimates the rate of the process better than previous approximations for values of mutation rates and selection coefficients that are compatible with the biological data.

title = {Muller's ratchet with compensatory mutations},
abstract = { We consider an infinite dimensional system of stochastic differential equations which describes the evolution of type frequencies in a large population. Random reproduction is modeled by a Wright-Fisher noise whose inverse diffusion coefficient {\$}N{\$} corresponds to the total population size. The type of an individual is the number {\$}k{\$} of deleterious mutations it carries. We assume that fitness of individuals carrying {\$}k{\$} mutations is decreased by {\$}\alpha k{\$} for some {\$}\alpha >0{\$}. Along the individual lines of descent, (new) mutations accumulate at rate {\$}\lambda{\$} per generation, and each of these mutations has a small probability {\$}\gamma{\$} per generation to disappear. While the case {\$}\gamma =0 {\$} is known as (the Fleming-Viot version of) {\em Muller's ratchet}, the case {\$}\gamma > 0{\$} is referred to as that of {\em compensatory mutations} in the biological literature. In the former case ({\$}\gamma=0{\$}), an ever increasing number of mutations is accumulated over time, while in the latter ({\$}\gamma > 0{\$}) this is prevented by the compensatory mutations which in this sense \emph{halt the ratchet}. We show that the system under consideration ({\$}\gamma\geq 0{\$}) has a unique weak solution. For {\$}N=\infty{\$}, we obtain the solution in a closed form by analyzing a probabilistic particle system that represents this solution. In particular, we show that the unique equilibrium state in the case {\$}\gamma>0{\$} and {\$}N=\infty{\$} is the Poisson distribution with parameter {\$}\lambda/(\gamma + \alpha){\$}. },

abstract = { The evolutionary force of recombination is lacking in asexually reproducing populations. As a consequence, the population can suffer an irreversible accumulation of deleterious mutations, a phenomenon known as Muller's ratchet. We formulate discrete and continuous time versions of Muller's ratchet. Inspired by Haigh's (1978) analysis of a dynamical system which arises in the limit of large populations, we identify the parameter gamma = N*lambda/(Ns*log(N*lambda)) as most important for the speed of accumulation of deleterious mutations. Here N is population size, s is the selection coefficient and lambda is the deleterious mutation rate. For large parts of the parameter range, measuring time in units of size N, deleterious mutations accumulate according to a power law in N*lambda with exponent gamma if gamma>0.5. For gamma<0.5 mutations cannot accumulate. We obtain diffusion approximations for three different parameter regimes, depending on the speed of the ratchet. Our approximations shed new light on analyses of Stephan et al. (1993) and Gordo {\&} Charlesworth (2000). The heuristics leading to the approximations are supported by simulations. },

title = {Amino-acid co-variation in HIV-1 Gag subtype C: HLA-mediated selection pressure and compensatory dynamics},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite high potential for HIV-1 genetic variation, the emergence of some mutations is constrained by fitness costs, and may be associated with compensatory amino acid (AA) co-variation. To characterize the interplay between Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated pressure and HIV-1 evolutionary pathways, we investigated AA co-variation in Gag sequences obtained from 449 South African individuals chronically infected with HIV-1 subtype C.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Individuals with CTL responses biased toward Gag presented lower viral loads than individuals with under-represented Gag-specific CTL responses. Using methods that account for founder effects and HLA linkage disequilibrium, we identified 35 AA sites under Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-restricted CTL selection pressure and 534 AA-to-AA interactions. Analysis of two-dimensional distances between co-varying residues revealed local stabilization mechanisms since 40% of associations involved neighboring residues. Key features of our co-variation analysis included sites with a high number of co-varying partners, such as HLA-associated sites, which had on average 55% more connections than other co-varying sites.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Clusters of co-varying AA around HLA-associated sites (especially at typically conserved sites) suggested that cooperative interactions act to preserve the local structural stability and protein function when CTL escape mutations occur. These results expose HLA-imprinted HIV-1 polymorphisms and their interlinked mutational paths in Gag that are likely due to opposite selective pressures from host CTL-mediated responses and viral fitness constraints.},

abstract = {Multiple lines of evidence support a role for CD8(+) T cells in control of acute/early HIV replication; however, features of the primary HIV-specific CD8(+) T cell response that may impact on the efficiency of containment of early viral replication remain poorly defined. In this study, we performed a novel, comprehensive analysis of the kinetics of expansion of components of the HIV-specific CD8(+) T cell response in 21 acutely infected individuals. Epitope-specific T cell responses expanded asynchronously during primary infection in all subjects. The most rapidly expanded responses peaked as early as 5 days following symptomatic presentation and were typically of very limited epitope breadth. Responses of additional specificities expanded and contracted in subsequent waves, resulting in successive shifts in the epitope immunodominance hierarchy over time. Sequence variation and escape were temporally associated with the decline in magnitude of only a subset of T cell responses, suggesting that other factors such as Ag load and T cell exhaustion may play a role in driving the contraction of HIV-specific T cell responses. These observations document the preferential expansion of CD8(+) T cells recognizing a subset of epitopes during the viral burst in acute HIV-1 infection and suggest that the nature of the initial, very rapidly expanded T cell response may influence the efficiency with which viral replication is contained in acute/early HIV infection.},

title = {Evidence for positive selection in the superoxide dismutase (Sod) region of Drosophila melanogaster},
abstract = {DNA sequence variation in a 1410-bp region including the Cu,Zn Sod locus was examined in 41 homozygous lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Fourteen lines were from Barcelona, Spain, 25 were from California populations and the other two were from laboratory stocks. Two common electromorphs, SODS and SODF, are segregating in the populations. Our sample of 41 lines included 19 SodS and 22 SodF alleles (henceforward referred to as Slow and Fast alleles). All 19 Slow alleles were identical in sequence. Of the 22 Fast alleles sequenced, nine were identical in sequence and are referred to as the Fast A haplotypes. The Slow allele sequence differed from the Fast A haplotype at a single nucleotide site, the site that accounts for the amino acid difference between SODS and SODF. There were nine other haplotypes among the remaining 13 Fast alleles sequenced. The overall level of nucleotide diversity (pi) in this sample is not greatly different than that found at other loci in D. melanogaster. It is concluded that the Slow/Fast polymorphism is a recently arisen polymorphism, not an old balanced polymorphism. The large group of nearly identical haplotypes suggests that a recent mutation, at the Sod locus or tightly linked to it, has increased rapidly in frequency to around 50%, both in California and Spain. The application of a new statistical test demonstrates that the occurrence of such large numbers of haplotypes with so little variation among them is very unlikely under the usual equilibrium neutral model. We suggest that the high frequency of some haplotypes is due to natural selection at the Sod locus or at a tightly linked locus.},

title = {Evolution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes: fitness-balanced escape},
abstract = {CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are strong mediators of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) control, yet HIV-1 frequently mutates to escape CTL recognition. In an analysis of sequences in the Los Alamos HIV-1 database, we show that emerging CTL escape mutations were more often present at lower frequencies than the amino acid(s) that they replaced. Furthermore, epitopes that underwent escape contained amino acid sites of high variability, whereas epitopes persisting at high frequencies lacked highly variable sites. We therefore infer that escape mutations are likely to be associated with weak functional constraints on the viral protein. This was supported by an extensive analysis of one subject for whom all escape mutations within defined CTL epitopes were studied and by an analysis of all reported escape mutations of defined CTL epitopes in the HIV Immunology Database. In one of these defined epitopes, escape mutations involving the substitution of amino acids with lower database frequencies occurred, and the epitope soon reverted back to the sensitive form. We further show that this escape mutation substantially diminished viral fitness in in vitro competition assays. Coincident with the reversion in vivo, we observed the fixation of a mutation 3 amino acids C terminal to the epitope, coincident with the ablation of the corresponding CTL response. The C-terminal mutation did not restore replication fitness reduced by the escape mutation in the epitope and by itself had little effect on replication fitness. Therefore, this C-terminal mutation presumably impaired the processing and presentation of the epitope. Finally, for one persistent epitope, CTL cross-reactivity to a mutant form may have suppressed the mutant to undetected levels, whereas for two other persistent epitopes, each of two mutants showed poor cross-reactivity and appeared in the subject at later time points. Thus, a viral dynamic exists between the advantage of immune escape, peptide cross-reactivity, and the disadvantage of lost replication fitness, with the balance playing an important role in determining whether a CTL epitope will persist or decline during infection.},

A model that includes these phenomena, as well as geographic subdivision and linkage to a polymorphism maintained either by local adaptation or by balancing selection, is derived, and the expected coalescence time for a pair of genes is calculated. It is found that background selection reduces coalescence times within subpopulations and allelic classes, leading to a high degree of apparent differentiation. Extremely high levels of subpopulation differentiation are also expected for regions of the genome surrounding loci important in local adaptation. These regions will be wider the stronger the local selection, and the higher the selfing rate.},

title = {Rapid reversion of sequence polymorphisms dominates early human immunodeficiency virus type 1 evolution},
abstract = {The error-prone replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) enables it to continuously evade host CD8+ T-cell responses. The observed transmission, and potential accumulation, of CD8+ T-cell escape mutations in the population may suggest a gradual adaptation of HIV-1 to immune pressures. Recent reports, however, have highlighted the propensity of some escape mutations to revert upon transmission to a new host in order to restore efficient replication capacity. To more specifically address the role of reversions in early HIV-1 evolution, we examined sequence polymorphisms arising across the HIV-1 genome in seven subjects followed longitudinally 1 year from primary infection. As expected, numerous nonsynonymous mutations were associated with described CD8+ T-cell epitopes, supporting a prominent role for cellular immune responses in driving early HIV-1 evolution. Strikingly, however, a substantial proportion of substitutions (42%) reverted toward the clade B consensus sequence, with nearly one-quarter of them located within defined CD8 epitopes not restricted by the contemporary host's HLA. More importantly, these reversions arose significantly faster than forward mutations, with the most rapidly reverting mutations preferentially arising within structurally conserved residues. These data suggest that many transmitted mutations likely incur a fitness cost that is recovered through retrieval of an optimal, or ancestral, form of the virus. The propensity of mutations to revert may limit the accumulation of immune pressure-driven mutations in the population, thus preserving critical CD8+ T-cell epitopes as vaccine targets, and argue against an unremitting adaptation of HIV-1 to host immune pressures.},

abstract = {The sequence diversity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) represents a major obstacle to the development of an effective vaccine, yet the forces impacting the evolution of this pathogen remain unclear. To address this issue we assessed the relationship between genome-wide viral evolution and adaptive CD8+ T-cell responses in four clade B virus-infected patients studied longitudinally for as long as 5 years after acute infection. Of the 98 amino acid mutations identified in nonenvelope antigens, 53% were associated with detectable CD8+ T-cell responses, indicative of positive selective immune pressures. An additional 18% of amino acid mutations represented substitutions toward common clade B consensus sequence residues, nine of which were strongly associated with HLA class I alleles not expressed by the subjects and thus indicative of reversions of transmitted CD8 escape mutations. Thus, nearly two-thirds of all mutations were attributable to CD8+ T-cell selective pressures. A closer examination of CD8 escape mutations in additional persons with chronic disease indicated that not only did immune pressures frequently result in selection of identical amino acid substitutions in mutating epitopes, but mutating residues also correlated with highly polymorphic sites in both clade B and C viruses. These data indicate a dominant role for cellular immune selective pressures in driving both individual and global HIV-1 evolution. The stereotypic nature of acquired mutations provides support for biochemical constraints limiting HIV-1 evolution and for the impact of CD8 escape mutations on viral fitness.},

abstract = {Typically during human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, a nearly homogeneous viral population first emerges and then diversifies over time due to selective forces that are poorly understood. To identify these forces, we conducted an intensive longitudinal study of viral genetic changes and T-cell immunity in one subject at < or =17 time points during his first 3 years of infection, and in his infecting partner near the time of transmission. Autologous peptides covering amino acid sites inferred to be under positive selection were powerful for identifying HIV-1-specific cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes. Positive selection and mutations resulting in escape from CTLs occurred across the viral proteome. We detected 25 CTL epitopes, including 14 previously unreported. Seven new epitopes mapped to the viral Env protein, emphasizing Env as a major target of CTLs. One-third of the selected sites were associated with epitopic mutational escapes from CTLs. Most of these resulted from replacement with amino acids found at low database frequency. Another one-third represented acquisition of amino acids found at high database frequency, suggesting potential reversions of CTL epitopic sites recognized by the immune system of the transmitting partner and mutation toward improved viral fitness in the absence of immune targeting within the recipient. A majority of the remaining selected sites occurred in the envelope protein and may have been subjected to humoral immune selection. Hence, a majority of the amino acids undergoing selection in this subject appeared to result from fitness-balanced CTL selection, confirming CTLs as a dominant selective force in HIV-1 infection.},

title = {Dynamics of DNA ejection from bacteriophage},
abstract = {The ejection of DNA from a bacterial virus (i.e., phage) into its host cell is a biologically important example of the translocation of a macromolecular chain along its length through a membrane. The simplest mechanism for this motion is diffusion, but in the case of phage ejection a significant driving force derives from the high degree of stress to which the DNA is subjected in the viral capsid. The translocation is further sped up by the ratcheting and entropic forces associated with proteins that bind to the viral DNA in the host cell cytoplasm. We formulate a generalized diffusion equation that includes these various pushing and pulling effects and make estimates of the corresponding speedups in the overall translocation process. Stress in the capsid is the dominant factor throughout early ejection, with the pull due to binding particles taking over at later stages. Confinement effects are also investigated, in the case where the phage injects its DNA into a volume comparable to the capsid size. Our results suggest a series of in vitro experiments involving the ejection of DNA into vesicles filled with varying amounts of binding proteins from phage whose state of stress is controlled by ambient salt conditions or by tuning genome length.},

title = {Emergent Neutrality in Adaptive Asexual Evolution},
abstract = {In non-recombining genomes, genetic linkage can be an important evolutionary force. Linkage generates interference interactions, by which simultaneously occurring mutations affect each other's chance of fixation. Here, we develop a comprehensive model of adaptive evolution in linked genomes, which integrates interference interactions between multiple beneficial and deleterious mutations into a unified framework. By an approximate analytical solution, we predict the fixation rates of these mutations, as well as the probabilities of beneficial and deleterious alleles at fixed genomic sites. We find that interference interactions generate a regime of emergent neutrality: all genomic sites with selection coefficients smaller in magnitude than a characteristic threshold have nearly random fixed alleles, and both beneficial and deleterious mutations at these sites have nearly neutral fixation rates. We show that this dynamics limits not only the speed of adaptation, but also a population's degree of adaptation in its current environment. We apply the model to different scenarios: stationary adaptation in a time-dependent environment, and approach to equilibrium in a fixed environment. In both cases, the analytical predictions are in good agreement with numerical simulations. Our results suggest that interference can severely compromise biological functions in an adapting population, which sets viability limits on adaptive evolution under linkage.},

abstract = {Selection of T-cell vaccine antigens for chronic persistent viral infections has been largely empirical. To define the relationship, at the population level, between the specificity of the cellular immune response and viral control for a relevant human pathogen, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the 160 dominant CD8(+) T-cell responses in 578 untreated HIV-infected individuals from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Of the HIV proteins targeted, only Gag-specific responses were associated with lowering viremia. Env-specific and Accessory/Regulatory protein-specific responses were associated with higher viremia. Increasing breadth of Gag-specific responses was associated with decreasing viremia and increasing Env breadth with increasing viremia. Association of the specific CD8(+) T-cell response with low viremia was independent of HLA type and unrelated to epitope sequence conservation. These population-based data, suggesting the existence of both effective immune responses and responses lacking demonstrable biological impact in chronic HIV infection, are of relevance to HIV vaccine design and evaluation.},

abstract = {The high levels of sequence diversity and rapid rates of evolution of HIV-1 represent the main challenges for developing effective therapies. However, there are constraints imposed by the three-dimensional protein structure that affect the sequence space accessible to the evolution of HIV-1. Here, we present a strategy for predicting the set of possible amino acid replacements in HIV. Our approach is based on the identification of likely amino acid changes in the context of these structural constraints using environment-specific substitution matrices as well as considering the physical constraints imposed by local structure. Assessment of the power of various published algorithms in predicting the evolution of HIV-1 Gag P17 shows that it is possible to use these methods to make accurate predictions of the sequence diversity. Our own method, SubFit, uses knowledge of local structural constraints; it achieves similar prediction success with the best-performing methods. We also show that erroneous predictions are largely due to infrequently occurring amino acids that will probably have severe fitness costs for the protein. Future improvements; for example, incorporating covariation and immunological constraints will permit more reliable prediction of viral evolution.},

abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evades CD8(+) T-cell responses through mutations within targeted epitopes, but little is known regarding its ability to generate de novo CD8(+) T-cell responses to such mutants. Here we examined gamma interferon-positive, HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses and autologous viral sequences in an HIV-1-infected individual for more than 6 years following acute infection. Fourteen optimal HIV-1 T-cell epitopes were targeted by CD8(+) T cells, four of which underwent mutation associated with dramatic loss of the original CD8(+) response. However, following the G(357)S escape in the HLA-A11-restricted Gag(349-359) epitope and the decline of wild-type-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses, a novel CD8(+) T-cell response equal in magnitude to the original response was generated against the variant epitope. CD8(+) T cells targeting the variant epitope did not exhibit cross-reactivity against the wild-type epitope but rather utilized a distinct T-cell receptor Vbeta repertoire. Additional studies of chronically HIV-1-infected individuals expressing HLA-A11 demonstrated that the majority of the subjects targeted the G(357)S escape variant of the Gag(349-359) epitope, while the wild-type consensus sequence was significantly less frequently recognized. These data demonstrate that de novo responses against escape variants of CD8(+) T-cell epitopes can be generated in chronic HIV-1 infection and provide the rationale for developing vaccines to induce CD8(+) T-cell responses directed against both the wild-type and variant forms of CD8 epitopes to prevent the emergence of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte escape variants.},

title = {Mutational analysis of HIV-1 long terminal repeats to explore the relative contribution of reverse transcriptase and RNA polymerase II to viral mutagenesis},
abstract = {HIV-1 evolves rapidly, which is thought to result from one or more error-prone steps in the virus life cycle. Because HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) does not possess 3'- to 5'-exonucleolytic proofreading activity and because RT has been shown to be error-prone in cell free systems, it should be an important contributor to the high rate of HIV-1 mutation. However, because RNA polymerase II (pol II) synthesizes viral RNA, it might also contribute significantly to HIV-1 mutagenesis. To assess the relative contributions of RT and RNA pol II to HIV-1 mutagenesis, a system was established to study the rate and nature of mutations in HIV-1 long terminal repeats (LTRs). Owing to the unique nature of replication at the ends of the viral genome, mutational analysis of retroviral LTRs provides an opportunity to evaluate the relative contribution of HIV-1 RT and RNA pol II to viral mutagenesis. Mutational analysis was performed on both LTRs of 215 proviruses, restricted to a single cycle of replication, employing single-stranded conformational polymorphism and DNA sequencing allowing direct identification of mutations in the absence of selection and within autologous viral sequences. A total of 21 independent mutations was identified. Ten mutations were observed in both LTRs, which could have been introduced by either RT or RNA pol II, whereas the other eleven mutations were only present in a single LTR and could only have been introduced by RT. This provides the first direct evidence that HIV-1 RT contributes significantly to HIV-1 mutagenesis and is likely to be the primary engine for HIV-1 mutagenesis. Moreover, mutations were observed at the U3-R border, but the nature of the mutations and their frequency differed from experiments performed using cell-free systems suggesting that other viral and/or cellular factors contribute to fidelity at the ends of the viral genome.},

title = {Dynamics of viral evolution and CTL responses in HIV-1 infection},
abstract = {Improved understanding of the dynamics of host immune responses and viral evolution is critical for effective HIV-1 vaccine design. We comprehensively analyzed Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-viral epitope dynamics in an antiretroviral therapy-na{\"\i}ve subject over the first four years of HIV-1 infection. We found that CTL responses developed sequentially and required constant antigenic stimulation for maintenance. CTL responses exerting strong selective pressure emerged early and led to rapid escape, proliferated rapidly and were predominant during acute/early infection. Although CTL responses to a few persistent epitopes developed over the first two months of infection, they proliferated slowly. As CTL epitopes were replaced by mutational variants, the corresponding responses immediately declined, most rapidly in the cases of strongly selected epitopes. CTL recognition of epitope variants, via cross-reactivity and de novo responses, was common throughout the period of study. Our data demonstrate that HIV-specific CTL responses, especially in the critical acute/early stage, were focused on regions that are prone to escape. Failure of CTL responses to strongly target functional or structurally critical regions of the virus, as well as the sequential cascade of CTL responses, followed closely by viral escape and decline of the corresponding responses, likely contribute to a lack of sustainable viral suppression. Focusing early and rapidly proliferating CTL on persistent epitopes may be essential for durable viral control in HIV-1 infection.},

title = {Pairwise comparisons of mitochondrial DNA sequences in stable and exponentially growing populations},
abstract = {We consider the distribution of pairwise sequence differences of mitochondrial DNA or of other nonrecombining portions of the genome in a population that has been of constant size and in a population that has been growing in size exponentially for a long time. We show that, in a population of constant size, the sample distribution of pairwise differences will typically deviate substantially from the geometric distribution expected, because the history of coalescent events in a single sample of genes imposes a substantial correlation on pairwise differences. Consequently, a goodness-of-fit test of observed pairwise differences to the geometric distribution, which assumes that each pairwise comparison is independent, is not a valid test of the hypothesis that the genes were sampled from a panmictic population of constant size. In an exponentially growing population in which the product of the current population size and the growth rate is substantially larger than one, our analytical and simulation results show that most coalescent events occur relatively early and in a restricted range of times. Hence, the "gene tree" will be nearly a "star phylogeny" and the distribution of pairwise differences will be nearly a Poisson distribution. In that case, it is possible to estimate r, the population growth rate, if the mutation rate, mu, and current population size, N0, are assumed known. The estimate of r is the solution to ri/mu = ln(N0r) - gamma, where i is the average pairwise difference and gamma approximately 0.577 is Euler's constant.},

abstract = {We studied the control parameters that govern the dynamics of in vitro DNA ejection in bacteriophage lambda. Previous work demonstrated that bacteriophage DNA is highly pressurized, and this pressure has been hypothesized to help drive DNA ejection. Ions influence this process by screening charges on DNA; however, a systematic variation of salt concentrations to explore these effects has not been undertaken. To study the nature of the forces driving DNA ejection, we performed in vitro measurements of DNA ejection in bulk and at the single-phage level. We present measurements on the dynamics of ejection and on the self-repulsion force driving ejection. We examine the role of ion concentration and identity in both measurements, and show that the charge of counterions is an important control parameter. These measurements show that the mobility of ejecting DNA is independent of ionic concentrations for a given amount of DNA in the capsid. We also present evidence that phage DNA forms loops during ejection, and confirm that this effect occurs using optical tweezers.},

title = {Adaptation of HIV-1 to human leukocyte antigen class I},
abstract = {The rapid and extensive spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic provides a rare opportunity to witness host-pathogen co-evolution involving humans. A focal point is the interaction between genes encoding human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and those encoding HIV proteins. HLA molecules present fragments (epitopes) of HIV proteins on the surface of infected cells to enable immune recognition and killing by CD8(+) T cells; particular HLA molecules, such as HLA-B*57, HLA-B*27 and HLA-B*51, are more likely to mediate successful control of HIV infection. Mutation within these epitopes can allow viral escape from CD8(+) T-cell recognition. Here we analysed viral sequences and HLA alleles from >2,800 subjects, drawn from 9 distinct study cohorts spanning 5 continents. Initial analysis of the HLA-B*51-restricted epitope, TAFTIPSI (reverse transcriptase residues 128-135), showed a strong correlation between the frequency of the escape mutation I135X and HLA-B*51 prevalence in the 9 study cohorts (P = 0.0001). Extending these analyses to incorporate other well-defined CD8(+) T-cell epitopes, including those restricted by HLA-B*57 and HLA-B*27, showed that the frequency of these epitope variants (n = 14) was consistently correlated with the prevalence of the restricting HLA allele in the different cohorts (together, P < 0.0001), demonstrating strong evidence of HIV adaptation to HLA at a population level. This process of viral adaptation may dismantle the well-established HLA associations with control of HIV infection that are linked to the availability of key epitopes, and highlights the challenge for a vaccine to keep pace with the changing immunological landscape presented by HIV.},

title = {Selection, transmission, and reversion of an antigen-processing cytotoxic T-lymphocyte escape mutation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection},
abstract = {Numerous studies now support that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evolution is influenced by immune selection pressure, with population studies showing an association between specific HLA alleles and mutations within defined cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes. Here we combine sequence data and functional studies of CD8 T-cell responses to demonstrate that allele-specific immune pressures also select for mutations flanking CD8 epitopes that impair antigen processing. In persons expressing HLA-A3, we demonstrate consistent selection for a mutation in a C-terminal flanking residue of the normally immunodominant Gag KK9 epitope that prevents its processing and presentation, resulting in a rapid decline in the CD8 T-cell response. This single amino acid substitution also lies within a second HLA-A3-restricted epitope, with the mutation directly impairing recognition by CD8 T cells. Transmission of the mutation to subjects expressing HLA-A3 was shown to prevent the induction of normally immunodominant acute-phase responses to both epitopes. However, subsequent in vivo reversion of the mutation was coincident with delayed induction of new CD8 T-cell responses to both epitopes. These data demonstrate that mutations within the flanking region of an HIV-1 epitope can impair recognition by an established CD8 T-cell response and that transmission of these mutations alters the acute-phase CD8(+) T-cell response. Moreover, reversion of these mutations in the absence of the original immune pressure reveals the potential plasticity of immunologically selected evolutionary changes.},

In the present study, novel mutations in the connection domain of RT (T369I/V), first identified in patient-derived viruses, were characterized, and their effects on NNRTI and NNRTI susceptibility were determined. Furthermore, the effect of N348I on NRTI and NNRTI resistance was confirmed. HIV-1 with either N348I or T369I/V demonstrated reduced susceptibility to nevirapine (NVP), efavirenz (EFV), delaviridine (DLV), and zidovudine (ZDV) compared to wild-type HIV-1. However, HIV-1 with T369I and N348I demonstrated 10- to 60-fold resistance to these same drugs. In clinical samples, these two connection domain RT mutations were predominantly observed in viruses containing TAMs and NNRTI mutations and did not alter the susceptible-resistant classifications of these samples. Introduction of T369I, N348I, or T369I/N348I also reduced replication capacity (RC). These observations suggest that it may be of scientific interest to test these mutations against new NNRTI candidates.},

title = {HLA-associated immune escape pathways in HIV-1 subtype B Gag, Pol and Nef proteins},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the extensive genetic diversity of HIV-1, viral evolution in response to immune selective pressures follows broadly predictable mutational patterns. Sites and pathways of Human Leukocyte-Antigen (HLA)-associated polymorphisms in HIV-1 have been identified through the analysis of population-level data, but the full extent of immune escape pathways remains incompletely characterized. Here, in the largest analysis of HIV-1 subtype B sequences undertaken to date, we identify HLA-associated polymorphisms in the three HIV-1 proteins most commonly considered in cellular-based vaccine strategies. Results are organized into protein-wide escape maps illustrating the sites and pathways of HLA-driven viral evolution.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: HLA-associated polymorphisms were identified in HIV-1 Gag, Pol and Nef in a multicenter cohort of >1500 chronically subtype-B infected, treatment-na{\"\i}ve individuals from established cohorts in Canada, the USA and Western Australia. At q< or =0.05, 282 codons commonly mutating under HLA-associated immune pressures were identified in these three proteins. The greatest density of associations was observed in Nef (where close to 40% of codons exhibited a significant HLA association), followed by Gag then Pol (where approximately 15-20% of codons exhibited HLA associations), confirming the extensive impact of immune selection on HIV evolution and diversity. Analysis of HIV codon covariation patterns identified over 2000 codon-codon interactions at q< or =0.05, illustrating the dense and complex networks of linked escape and secondary/compensatory mutations.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The immune escape maps and associated data are intended to serve as a user-friendly guide to the locations of common escape mutations and covarying codons in HIV-1 subtype B, and as a resource facilitating the systematic identification and classification of immune escape mutations. These resources should facilitate research in HIV epitope discovery and host-pathogen co-evolution, and are relevant to the continued search for an effective CTL-based AIDS vaccine.},

title = {Phylogenetic dependency networks: inferring patterns of CTL escape and codon covariation in HIV-1 Gag},
abstract = {HIV avoids elimination by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) through the evolution of escape mutations. Although there is mounting evidence that these escape pathways are broadly consistent among individuals with similar human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles, previous population-based studies have been limited by the inability to simultaneously account for HIV codon covariation, linkage disequilibrium among HLA alleles, and the confounding effects of HIV phylogeny when attempting to identify HLA-associated viral evolution. We have developed a statistical model of evolution, called a phylogenetic dependency network, that accounts for these three sources of confounding and identifies the primary sources of selection pressure acting on each HIV codon. Using synthetic data, we demonstrate the utility of this approach for identifying sites of HLA-mediated selection pressure and codon evolution as well as the deleterious effects of failing to account for all three sources of confounding. We then apply our approach to a large, clinically-derived dataset of Gag p17 and p24 sequences from a multicenter cohort of 1144 HIV-infected individuals from British Columbia, Canada (predominantly HIV-1 clade B) and Durban, South Africa (predominantly HIV-1 clade C). The resulting phylogenetic dependency network is dense, containing 149 associations between HLA alleles and HIV codons and 1386 associations among HIV codons. These associations include the complete reconstruction of several recently defined escape and compensatory mutation pathways and agree with emerging data on patterns of epitope targeting. The phylogenetic dependency network adds to the growing body of literature suggesting that sites of escape, order of escape, and compensatory mutations are largely consistent even across different clades, although we also identify several differences between clades. As recent case studies have demonstrated, understanding both the complexity and the consistency of immune escape has important implications for CTL-based vaccine design. Phylogenetic dependency networks represent a major step toward systematically expanding our understanding of CTL escape to diverse populations and whole viral genes.},

title = {Evolution of CD8+ T cell immunity and viral escape following acute HIV-1 infection},
abstract = {Induction of HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells during acute infection is associated with a decline in viremia. The role CD8(+) effectors play in subsequently establishing viral set point remains unclear. To address this, we focused on two acutely infected patients with the same initial Tat-specific CD8(+) response, analyzing their CD8(+) T cell responses longitudinally in conjunction with viral load and sequence evolution. In one patient initiating treatment during acute infection, the frequencies of Tat-specific CD8(+) T cells gradually diminished but persisted, and the Tat epitope sequence was unaltered. By contrast, in the second patient who declined treatment, the Tat-specific CD8(+) T cells disappeared below detection, in conjunction with Gag-specific CD4(+) T cell loss, as plasma viremia reached a set point. This coincided with the emergence of an escape variant within the Tat epitope and an additional Vpr epitope. New CD8(+) T cell responses emerged but with no further associated decline in viremia. These findings indicate that, in the absence of treatment, the initial CD8(+) T cell responses have the greatest impact on reducing viremia, and that later, continuously evolving responses are less efficient in further reducing viral load. The results also suggest that T cell help may contribute to the antiviral efficiency of the acute CD8(+) T cell response.},

In the particular case of bacteriophage lambda, the ejection is 50% inhibited by osmotic pressures (of polyethylene glycol) comparable to those operative in the cytoplasm of host bacteria; it is completely suppressed by a pressure of 20 atmospheres. Furthermore, our experiments monitor directly a dramatic decrease of the stress inside the unopened phage capsid upon addition of polyvalent cations to the host solution, in agreement with many recent theories of DNA interactions.},

title = {Distinguishing Driver and Passenger Mutations in an Evolutionary History Categorized by Interference},
abstract = {In many biological scenarios, from the development of drug resistance in pathogens to the progression of healthy cells towards cancer, quantifying the selection acting on observed mutations is a central question. One difficulty in answering this question is the complexity of the background upon which mutations can arise, with multiple potential interactions between genetic loci. We here present a method for discerning selection from a population history which accounts for interference between mutations. Given sequences sampled from multiple time-points in the history of a population, we infer selection at each locus by maximizing a likelihood function derived from a multi-locus evolution model. We apply the method to the question of distinguishing between loci where new mutations are under positive selection (drivers) and loci which emit neutral mutations (passengers) in a Wright-Fisher model of evolution. Relative to an otherwise equivalent method in which the genetic background of mutations was ignored, our method inferred selection coefficients more accurately for both driver mutations evolving under clonal interference, and for passenger mutations reaching fixation in the population through genetic drift or hitchhiking. In a population history recorded by 750 sets of sequences of 100 individuals taken at intervals of 100 generations, a set of 50 loci were divided into drivers and passengers with a mean accuracy of greater than 0.95 across a range of numbers of driver loci. The potential application of our model, either in full or in part, to a range of biological systems, is discussed.},

We describe the majority of common small-scale polymorphisms as well as many larger insertions and deletions in the A. thaliana pan-genome, their effects on gene function, and the patterns of local and global linkage among these variants. The action of processes other than spontaneous mutation is identified by comparing the spectrum of mutations that have accumulated since A. thaliana diverged from its closest relative 10 million years ago with the spectrum observed in the laboratory. Recent species-wide selective sweeps are rare, and potentially deleterious mutations are more common in marginal populations.},

title = {Evidence for positive selection in the superoxide dismutase ({Sod}) region of {Drosophila melanogaster}},
abstract = {DNA sequence variation in a 1410-bp region including the Cu,Zn Sod locus was examined in 41 homozygous lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Fourteen lines were from Barcelona, Spain, 25 were from California populations and the other two were from laboratory stocks. Two common electromorphs, SODS and SODF, are segregating in the populations. Our sample of 41 lines included 19 SodS and 22 SodF alleles (henceforward referred to as Slow and Fast alleles). All 19 Slow alleles were identical in sequence. Of the 22 Fast alleles sequenced, nine were identical in sequence and are referred to as the Fast A haplotypes. The Slow allele sequence differed from the Fast A haplotype at a single nucleotide site, the site that accounts for the amino acid difference between SODS and SODF. There were nine other haplotypes among the remaining 13 Fast alleles sequenced. The overall level of nucleotide diversity (pi) in this sample is not greatly different than that found at other loci in D. melanogaster. It is concluded that the Slow/Fast polymorphism is a recently arisen polymorphism, not an old balanced polymorphism. The large group of nearly identical haplotypes suggests that a recent mutation, at the Sod locus or tightly linked to it, has increased rapidly in frequency to around 50%, both in California and Spain. The application of a new statistical test demonstrates that the occurrence of such large numbers of haplotypes with so little variation among them is very unlikely under the usual equilibrium neutral model. We suggest that the high frequency of some haplotypes is due to natural selection at the Sod locus or at a tightly linked locus.},

title = {Mutational analysis of HIV-1 long terminal repeats to explore the relative contribution of reverse transcriptase and RNA polymerase II to viral mutagenesis},
abstract = {HIV-1 evolves rapidly, which is thought to result from one or more error-prone steps in the virus life cycle. Because HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) does not possess 3'- to 5'-exonucleolytic proofreading activity and because RT has been shown to be error-prone in cell free systems, it should be an important contributor to the high rate of HIV-1 mutation. However, because RNA polymerase II (pol II) synthesizes viral RNA, it might also contribute significantly to HIV-1 mutagenesis. To assess the relative contributions of RT and RNA pol II to HIV-1 mutagenesis, a system was established to study the rate and nature of mutations in HIV-1 long terminal repeats (LTRs). Owing to the unique nature of replication at the ends of the viral genome, mutational analysis of retroviral LTRs provides an opportunity to evaluate the relative contribution of HIV-1 RT and RNA pol II to viral mutagenesis. Mutational analysis was performed on both LTRs of 215 proviruses, restricted to a single cycle of replication, employing single-stranded conformational polymorphism and DNA sequencing allowing direct identification of mutations in the absence of selection and within autologous viral sequences. A total of 21 independent mutations was identified. Ten mutations were observed in both LTRs, which could have been introduced by either RT or RNA pol II, whereas the other eleven mutations were only present in a single LTR and could only have been introduced by RT. This provides the first direct evidence that HIV-1 RT contributes significantly to HIV-1 mutagenesis and is likely to be the primary engine for HIV-1 mutagenesis. Moreover, mutations were observed at the U3-R border, but the nature of the mutations and their frequency differed from experiments performed using cell-free systems suggesting that other viral and/or cellular factors contribute to fidelity at the ends of the viral genome.},

title = {Pairwise comparisons of mitochondrial {DNA} sequences in stable and exponentially growing populations},
abstract = {We consider the distribution of pairwise sequence differences of mitochondrial DNA or of other nonrecombining portions of the genome in a population that has been of constant size and in a population that has been growing in size exponentially for a long time. We show that, in a population of constant size, the sample distribution of pairwise differences will typically deviate substantially from the geometric distribution expected, because the history of coalescent events in a single sample of genes imposes a substantial correlation on pairwise differences. Consequently, a goodness-of-fit test of observed pairwise differences to the geometric distribution, which assumes that each pairwise comparison is independent, is not a valid test of the hypothesis that the genes were sampled from a panmictic population of constant size. In an exponentially growing population in which the product of the current population size and the growth rate is substantially larger than one, our analytical and simulation results show that most coalescent events occur relatively early and in a restricted range of times. Hence, the ``gene tree" will be nearly a ``star phylogeny" and the distribution of pairwise differences will be nearly a Poisson distribution. In that case, it is possible to estimate r, the population growth rate, if the mutation rate, mu, and current population size, N0, are assumed known. The estimate of r is the solution to ri/mu = ln(N0r) - gamma, where i is the average pairwise difference and gamma approximately 0.577 is Euler's constant.},

abstract = {Recombination has essential functions in mammalian meiosis, which impose several constraints on the recombination process. However, recent studies have shown that, in spite of these roles, recombination rates vary tremendously among humans, and show marked differences between humans and closely related species. These findings provide important insights into the determinants of recombination rates and raise new questions about the selective pressures that affect recombination over different genomic scales, with implications for human genetics and evolutionary biology.},

abstract = {The fixation of a beneficial allele in a population leaves a well-characterized signature in patterns of nucleotide variation at linked sites. This signature can be used to estimate the time since fixation from patterns of polymorphism in extant individuals. I introduce a method to assess the support in polymorphism data for a recent episode of directional positive selection and to estimate the time since fixation. I summarize the polymorphism data by three statistics that carry information about levels of diversity, the allele frequency spectrum, and the extent of allelic associations. Simulations are then used to obtain a sample from the posterior distribution of the time since fixation, conditional on the observed summaries. I test the performance of the approach on simulated data and apply it to the gene tb1 in maize. The data support the recent fixation of a favored allele, consistent with what is known about the importance of tb1 in the domestication process of maize.},

title = {Genome-wide analysis of a long-term evolution experiment with {Drosophila}},
abstract = {Experimental evolution systems allow the genomic study of adaptation, and so far this has been done primarily in asexual systems with small genomes, such as bacteria and yeast. Here we present whole-genome resequencing data from Drosophila melanogaster populations that have experienced over 600 generations of laboratory selection for accelerated development. Flies in these selected populations develop from egg to adult ∼20% faster than flies of ancestral control populations, and have evolved a number of other correlated phenotypes. On the basis of 688,520 intermediate-frequency, high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms, we identify several dozen genomic regions that show strong allele frequency differentiation between a pooled sample of five replicate populations selected for accelerated development and pooled controls. On the basis of resequencing data from a single replicate population with accelerated development, as well as single nucleotide polymorphism data from individual flies from each replicate population, we infer little allele frequency differentiation between replicate populations within a selection treatment. Signatures of selection are qualitatively different than what has been observed in asexual species; in our sexual populations, adaptation is not associated with 'classic' sweeps whereby newly arising, unconditionally advantageous mutations become fixed. More parsimonious explanations include 'incomplete' sweep models, in which mutations have not had enough time to fix, and 'soft' sweep models, in which selection acts on pre-existing, common genetic variants. We conclude that, at least for life history characters such as development time, unconditionally advantageous alleles rarely arise, are associated with small net fitness gains or cannot fix because selection coefficients change over time.},

abstract = {We used ultra-deep sequencing to obtain tens of thousands of HIV-1 sequences from regions targeted by CD8+ T lymphocytes from longitudinal samples from three acutely infected subjects, and modeled viral evolution during the critical first weeks of infection. Previous studies suggested that a single virus established productive infection, but these conclusions were tempered because of limited sampling; now, we have greatly increased our confidence in this observation through modeling the observed earliest sample diversity based on vastly more extensive sampling. Conventional sequencing of HIV-1 from acute/early infection has shown different patterns of escape at different epitopes; we investigated the earliest escapes in exquisite detail. Over 3-6 weeks, ultradeep sequencing revealed that the virus explored an extraordinary array of potential escape routes in the process of evading the earliest CD8 T-lymphocyte responses--using 454 sequencing, we identified over 50 variant forms of each targeted epitope during early immune escape, while only 2-7 variants were detected in the same samples via conventional sequencing. In contrast to the diversity seen within epitopes, non-epitope regions, including the Envelope V3 region, which was sequenced as a control in each subject, displayed very low levels of variation. In early infection, in the regions sequenced, the consensus forms did not have a fitness advantage large enough to trigger reversion to consensus amino acids in the absence of immune pressure. In one subject, a genetic bottleneck was observed, with extensive diversity at the second time point narrowing to two dominant escape forms by the third time point, all within two months of infection. Traces of immune escape were observed in the earliest samples, suggesting that immune pressure is present and effective earlier than previously reported; quantifying the loss rate of the founder virus suggests a direct role for CD8 T-lymphocyte responses in viral containment after peak viremia. Dramatic shifts in the frequencies of epitope variants during the first weeks of infection revealed a complex interplay between viral fitness and immune escape.},

Noise, far from just a nuisance, has begun to be appreciated for its essential role in key cellular activities. Noise functions in both microbial and eukaryotic cells, in multicellular development, and in evolution. It enables coordination of gene expression across large regulons, as well as probabilistic differentiation strategies that function across cell populations. At the longest timescales, noise may facilitate evolutionary transitions. Here we review examples and emerging principles that connect noise, the architecture of the gene circuits in which it is present, and the biological functions it enables. We further indicate some of the important challenges and opportunities going forward.},

abstract = {Identification of the transmitted/founder virus makes possible, for the first time, a genome-wide analysis of host immune responses against the infecting HIV-1 proteome. A complete dissection was made of the primary HIV-1-specific T cell response induced in three acutely infected patients. Cellular assays, together with new algorithms which identify sites of positive selection in the virus genome, showed that primary HIV-1-specific T cells rapidly select escape mutations concurrent with falling virus load in acute infection. Kinetic analysis and mathematical modeling of virus immune escape showed that the contribution of CD8 T cell-mediated killing of productively infected cells was earlier and much greater than previously recognized and that it contributed to the initial decline of plasma virus in acute infection. After virus escape, these first T cell responses often rapidly waned, leaving or being succeeded by T cell responses to epitopes which escaped more slowly or were invariant. These latter responses are likely to be important in maintaining the already established virus set point. In addition to mutations selected by T cells, there were other selected regions that accrued mutations more gradually but were not associated with a T cell response. These included clusters of mutations in envelope that were targeted by NAbs, a few isolated sites that reverted to the consensus sequence, and bystander mutations in linkage with T cell-driven escape.},

title = {Genomic scans for selective sweeps using SNP data},
abstract = {Detecting selective sweeps from genomic SNP data is complicated by the intricate ascertainment schemes used to discover SNPs, and by the confounding influence of the underlying complex demographics and varying mutation and recombination rates. Current methods for detecting selective sweeps have little or no robustness to the demographic assumptions and varying recombination rates, and provide no method for correcting for ascertainment biases. Here, we present several new tests aimed at detecting selective sweeps from genomic SNP data. Using extensive simulations, we show that a new parametric test, based on composite likelihood, has a high power to detect selective sweeps and is surprisingly robust to assumptions regarding recombination rates and demography (i.e., has low Type I error). Our new test also provides estimates of the location of the selective sweep(s) and the magnitude of the selection coefficient. To illustrate the method, we apply our approach to data from the Seattle SNP project and to Chromosome 2 data from the HapMap project. In Chromosome 2, the most extreme signal is found in the lactase gene, which previously has been shown to be undergoing positive selection. Evidence for selective sweeps is also found in many other regions, including genes known to be associated with disease risk such as DPP10 and COL4A3.},

A promising approach is to investigate gene expression levels considered as tractable intermediate phenotypes in mapping complex diseases. However, how transcription varies across the MHC, notably relative to specific haplotypes, remains unknown. Here, using an original hybrid tiling and splice junction microarray that includes alternate allele probes, we draw the first high-resolution strand-specific transcription map for three common MHC haplotypes (HLA-A1-B8-Cw7-DR3, HLA-A3-B7-Cw7-DR15, and HLA-A26-B18-Cw5-DR3-DQ2) strongly associated with autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis. We find that haplotype-specific differences in gene expression are common across the MHC, affecting 96 genes (46.4%), most significantly the zing finger protein gene ZFP57. Differentially expressed probes are correlated with polymorphisms between haplotypes, consistent with cis effects that we directly demonstrate for ZFP57 in a cohort of healthy volunteers (P = 1.2 × 10(-14)). We establish that alternative splicing is significantly more frequent in the MHC than genome-wide (72.5% vs. 62.1% of genes, P ≤ 1 × 10(-4)) and shows marked haplotypic differences. We also unmask novel and abundant intergenic transcription involving 31% of transcribed blocks identified. Our study reveals that the renowned MHC polymorphism also manifests as transcript diversity, and our novel haplotype-based approach marks a new step toward identification of regulatory variants involved in the control of MHC-associated phenotypes and diseases.},

Although serum paraoxonase (PON1) is a leading candidate for such a treatment, it hydrolyzes the toxic S(p) isomers of G-agents with very slow rates. We improved PON1's catalytic efficiency by combining random and targeted mutagenesis with high-throughput screening using fluorogenic analogs in emulsion compartments. We thereby enhanced PON1's activity toward the coumarin analog of S(p)-cyclosarin by ∼10(5)-fold. We also developed a direct screen for protection of acetylcholinesterase from inactivation by nerve agents and used it to isolate variants that degrade the toxic isomer of the coumarin analog and cyclosarin itself with k(cat)/K(M) ∼ 10(7) M(-1) min(-1). We then demonstrated the in vivo prophylactic activity of an evolved variant. These evolved variants and the newly developed screens provide the basis for engineering PON1 for prophylaxis against other G-type agents.},

title = {Slow protein evolutionary rates are dictated by surface-core association},
abstract = {Why do certain proteins evolve much slower than others? We compared not only rates per protein, but also rates per position within individual proteins. For ∼90% of proteins, the distribution of positional rates exhibits three peaks: a peak of slow evolving residues, with average log(2)[normalized rate], log(2)μ, of ca. -2, corresponding primarily to core residues; a peak of fast evolving residues (log(2)μ ∼ 0.5) largely corresponding to surface residues; and a very fast peak (log(2)μ ∼ 2) associated with disordered segments. However, a unique fraction of proteins that evolve very slowly exhibit not only a negligible fast peak, but also a peak with a log(2)μ ∼ -4, rather than the standard core peak of -2. Thus, a "freeze" of a protein's surface seems to stop core evolution as well. We also observed a much higher fraction of substitutions in potentially interacting residues than expected by chance, including substitutions in pairs of contacting surface-core residues. Overall, the data suggest that accumulation of surface substitutions enables the acceptance of substitutions in core positions. The underlying reason for slow evolution might therefore be a highly constrained surface due to protein-protein interactions or the need to prevent misfolding or aggregation. If the surface is inaccessible to substitutions, so becomes the core, thus resulting in very slow overall rates.},

title = {Pervasive adaptive protein evolution apparent in diversity patterns around amino acid substitutions in Drosophila simulans},
abstract = {In Drosophila, multiple lines of evidence converge in suggesting that beneficial substitutions to the genome may be common. All suffer from confounding factors, however, such that the interpretation of the evidence-in particular, conclusions about the rate and strength of beneficial substitutions-remains tentative. Here, we use genome-wide polymorphism data in D. simulans and sequenced genomes of its close relatives to construct a readily interpretable characterization of the effects of positive selection: the shape of average neutral diversity around amino acid substitutions. As expected under recurrent selective sweeps, we find a trough in diversity levels around amino acid but not around synonymous substitutions, a distinctive pattern that is not expected under alternative models. This characterization is richer than previous approaches, which relied on limited summaries of the data (e.g., the slope of a scatter plot), and relates to underlying selection parameters in a straightforward way, allowing us to make more reliable inferences about the prevalence and strength of adaptation. Specifically, we develop a coalescent-based model for the shape of the entire curve and use it to infer adaptive parameters by maximum likelihood. Our inference suggests that ∼13% of amino acid substitutions cause selective sweeps. Interestingly, it reveals two classes of beneficial fixations: a minority (approximately 3%) that appears to have had large selective effects and accounts for most of the reduction in diversity, and the remaining 10%, which seem to have had very weak selective effects. These estimates therefore help to reconcile the apparent conflict among previously published estimates of the strength of selection. More generally, our findings provide unequivocal evidence for strongly beneficial substitutions in Drosophila and illustrate how the rapidly accumulating genome-wide data can be leveraged to address enduring questions about the genetic basis of adaptation.},

title = {Explaining complex codon usage patterns with selection for translational efficiency, mutation bias, and genetic drift},
abstract = {The genetic code is redundant with most amino acids using multiple codons. In many organisms, codon usage is biased toward particular codons. Understanding the adaptive and nonadaptive forces driving the evolution of codon usage bias (CUB) has been an area of intense focus and debate in the fields of molecular and evolutionary biology. However, their relative importance in shaping genomic patterns of CUB remains unsolved. Using a nested model of protein translation and population genetics, we show that observed gene level variation of CUB in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be explained almost entirely by selection for efficient ribosomal usage, genetic drift, and biased mutation. The correlation between observed codon counts within individual genes and our model predictions is 0.96. Although a variety of factors shape patterns of CUB at the level of individual sites within genes, our results suggest that selection for efficient ribosome usage is a central force in shaping codon usage at the genomic scale. In addition, our model allows direct estimation of codon-specific mutation rates and elongation times and can be readily applied to any organism with high-throughput expression datasets. More generally, we have developed a natural framework for integrating models of molecular processes to population genetics models to quantitatively estimate parameters underlying fundamental biological processes, such a protein translation.},

abstract = {The CD8+ T-cell is a key mediator of antiviral immunity, potentially contributing to control of pathogenic lentiviral infection through both innate and adaptive mechanisms. We studied viral dynamics during antiretroviral treatment of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infected rhesus macaques following CD8+ T-cell depletion to test the importance of adaptive cytotoxic effects in clearance of cells productively infected with SIV. As previously described, plasma viral load (VL) increased following CD8+ T-cell depletion and was proportional to the magnitude of CD8+ T-cell depletion in the GALT, confirming a direct relationship between CD8+ T-cell loss and viral replication. Surprisingly, first phase plasma virus decay following administration of antiretroviral drugs was not slower in CD8+ T-cell depleted animals compared with controls indicating that the short lifespan of the average productively infected cell is not a reflection of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) killing. Our findings support a dominant role for non-cytotoxic effects of CD8+ T-cells on control of pathogenic lentiviral infection and suggest that cytotoxic effects, if present, are limited to early, pre-productive stages of the viral life cycle. These observations have important implications for future strategies to augment immune control of HIV.},

abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infections are characterized by early peaks of viraemia that decline as strong cellular immune responses develop. Although it has been shown that virus-specific CD8-positive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) exert selective pressure during HIV and SIV infection, the data have been controversial. Here we show that Tat-specific CD8-positive T-lymphocyte responses select for new viral escape variants during the acute phase of infection. We sequenced the entire virus immediately after the acute phase, and found that amino-acid replacements accumulated primarily in Tat CTL epitopes. This implies that Tat-specific CTLs may be significantly involved in controlling wild-type virus replication, and suggests that responses against viral proteins that are expressed early during the viral life cycle might be attractive targets for HIV vaccine development.},

title = {The genetics of human adaptation: hard sweeps, soft sweeps, and polygenic adaptation},
abstract = {There has long been interest in understanding the genetic basis of human adaptation. To what extent are phenotypic differences among human populations driven by natural selection? With the recent arrival of large genome-wide data sets on human variation, there is now unprecedented opportunity for progress on this type of question. Several lines of evidence argue for an important role of positive selection in shaping human variation and differences among populations. These include studies of comparative morphology and physiology, as well as population genetic studies of candidate loci and genome-wide data. However, the data also suggest that it is unusual for strong selection to drive new mutations rapidly to fixation in particular populations (the 'hard sweep' model). We argue, instead, for alternatives to the hard sweep model: in particular, polygenic adaptation could allow rapid adaptation while not producing classical signatures of selective sweeps. We close by discussing some of the likely opportunities for progress in the field.},

title = {Stability effects of mutations and protein evolvability},
abstract = {The past several years have seen novel insights at the interface of protein biophysics and evolution. The accepted paradigm that proteins can tolerate nearly any amino acid substitution has been replaced by the view that the deleterious effects of mutations, and especially their tendency to undermine the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of protein, is a major constraint on protein evolvability--the ability of proteins to acquire changes in sequence and function. We summarize recent findings regarding how mutations affect protein stability, and how stability affects protein evolution. We describe ways of predicting and analyzing stability effects of mutations, and mechanisms that buffer or compensate for these destabilizing effects and thereby promote protein evolvabilty, in nature and in the laboratory.},

title = {Chaperonin overexpression promotes genetic variation and enzyme evolution},
abstract = {Most protein mutations, and mutations that alter protein functions in particular, undermine stability and are therefore deleterious. Chaperones, or heat-shock proteins, are often implicated in buffering mutations, and could thus facilitate the acquisition of neutral genetic diversity and the rate of adaptation. We examined the ability of the Escherichia coli GroEL/GroES chaperonins to buffer destabilizing and adaptive mutations. Here we show that mutational drifts performed in vitro with four different enzymes indicated that GroEL/GroES overexpression doubled the number of accumulating mutations, and promoted the folding of enzyme variants carrying mutations in the protein core and/or mutations with higher destabilizing effects (destabilization energies of >3.5 kcal mol(-)(1), on average, versus approximately 1 kcal mol(-)(1) in the absence of GroEL/GroES). The divergence of modified enzymatic specificity occurred much faster under GroEL/GroES overexpression, in terms of the number of adapted variants (>or=2-fold) and their improved specificity and activity (>or=10-fold). These results indicate that protein stability is a major constraint in protein evolution, and buffering mechanisms such as chaperonins are key in alleviating this constraint.},

abstract = {While CD8+ T cells are clearly important in controlling virus replication during HIV and SIV infections, the mechanisms underlying this antiviral effect remain poorly understood. In this study, we assessed the in vivo effect of CD8+ lymphocyte depletion on the lifespan of productively infected cells during chronic SIVmac239 infection of rhesus macaques. We treated two groups of animals that were either CD8+ lymphocyte-depleted or controls with antiretroviral therapy, and used mathematical modeling to assess the lifespan of infected cells either in the presence or absence of CD8+ lymphocytes. We found that, in both early (day 57 post-SIV) and late (day 177 post-SIV) chronic SIV infection, depletion of CD8+ lymphocytes did not result in a measurable increase in the lifespan of either short- or long-lived productively infected cells in vivo. This result indicates that the presence of CD8+ lymphocytes does not result in a noticeably shorter lifespan of productively SIV-infected cells, and thus that direct cell killing is unlikely to be the main mechanism underlying the antiviral effect of CD8+ T cells in SIV-infected macaques with high virus replication.},

abstract = {HIV adaptation to a host in chronic infection is simulated by means of a Monte-Carlo algorithm that includes the evolutionary factors of mutation, positive selection with varying strength among sites, random genetic drift, linkage, and recombination. By comparing two sensitive measures of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the number of diverse sites measured in simulation to patient data from one-time samples of pol gene obtained by single-genome sequencing from representative untreated patients, we estimate the effective recombination rate and the average selection coefficient to be on the order of 1% per genome per generation (10(-5) per base per generation) and 0.5%, respectively. The adaptation rate is twofold higher and fourfold lower than predicted in the absence of recombination and in the limit of very frequent recombination, respectively. The level of LD and the number of diverse sites observed in data also range between the values predicted in simulation for these two limiting cases. These results demonstrate the critical importance of finite population size, linkage, and recombination in HIV evolution.},

However, most subsequent work has simplified their approach by assuming that the number of individuals with the advantageous allele follows the logistic differential equation. We show that the impact of a selective sweep can be accurately approximated by a random partition created by a stick-breaking process. Our simulation results show that ignoring the randomness when the number of individuals with the advantageous allele is small can lead to substantial errors.},

title = {Nucleosome positioning in a model of active chromatin remodeling enzymes},
abstract = {Accounting for enzyme-mediated active sliding, disassembly, and sequence-dependent positioning of nucleosomes, we simulate nucleosome occupancy over cell-cycle-scale times using a stochastic kinetic model. We show that ATP-dependent active nucleosome sliding and nucleosome removal processes are essential to obtain in vivo-like nucleosome positioning. While active sliding leads to dense nucleosome filling, sliding events alone cannot ensure sequence-dependent nucleosome positioning: Active nucleosome removal is the crucial remodeling event that drives positioning. We also show that remodeling activity changes nucleosome dynamics from glassy to liquid-like, and that remodeling dramatically influences exposure dynamics of promoter regions.},

title = {Differential Persistence of Transmitted HIV-1 Drug Resistance Mutation Classes},
abstract = {Background. Transmitted human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) drug resistance (TDR) mutations can become replaced over time by emerging wild-type viral variants with improved fitness. The impact of class-specific mutations on this rate of mutation replacement is uncertain. Methods. We studied participants with acute and/or early HIV infection and TDR in 2 cohorts (San Francisco, California, and S{\~a}o Paulo, Brazil). We followed baseline mutations longitudinally and compared replacement rates between mutation classes with use of a parametric proportional hazards model. Results. Among 75 individuals with 195 TDR mutations, M184V/I became undetectable markedly faster than did nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations (hazard ratio, 77.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 14.7-408.2; P < .0001), while protease inhibitor and NNRTI replacement rates were similar. Higher plasma HIV-1 RNA level predicted faster mutation replacement, but this was not statistically significant (hazard ratio, 1.71 log(10) copies/mL; 95% CI, .90-3.25 log(10) copies/mL; P = .11). We found substantial person-to-person variability in mutation replacement rates not accounted for by viral load or mutation class (P < .0001). Conclusions. The rapid replacement of M184V/I mutations is consistent with known fitness costs. The long-term persistence of NNRTI and protease inhibitor mutations suggests a risk for person-to-person propagation. Host and/or viral factors not accounted for by viral load or mutation class are likely influencing mutation replacement and warrant further study.},

title = {Forced periodic expression of G1 cyclins phase-locks the budding yeast cell cycle},
abstract = {Phase-locking (frequency entrainment) of an oscillator, in which a periodic extrinsic signal drives oscillations at a frequency different from the unperturbed frequency, is a useful property for study of oscillator stability and structure. The cell cycle is frequently described as a biochemical oscillator; however, because this oscillator is tied to key biological events such as DNA replication and segregation, and to cell growth (cell mass increase), it is unclear whether phase locking is possible for the cell cycle oscillator. We found that forced periodic expression of the G(1) cyclin CLN2 phase locks the cell cycle of budding yeast over a range of extrinsic periods in an exponentially growing monolayer culture. We characterize the behavior of cells in a pedigree using a return map to determine the efficiency of entrainment to the externally controlled pulse. We quantify differences between mothers and daughters and how synchronization of an expanding population differs from synchronization of a single oscillator. Mothers only lock intermittently whereas daughters lock completely and in a different period range than mothers. We can explain quantitative features of phase locking in both cell types with an analytically solvable model based on cell size control and how mass is partitioned between mother and daughter cells. A key prediction of this model is that size control can occur not only in G(1), but also later in the cell cycle under the appropriate conditions; this prediction is confirmed in our experimental data. Our results provide quantitative insight into how cell size is integrated with the cell cycle oscillator.},

This result is derived analytically in a simplified setting where the mutational neighborhood is fixed during the adaptive process, and confirmed by numerical simulations. },

abstract = {Despite the common use of the blooming metaphor, its floral inspiration remains poorly understood. Here we study the physical process of blooming in the asiatic lily Lilium casablanca. Our observations show that the edges of the petals wrinkle as the flower opens, suggesting that differential growth drives the deployment of these laminar shell-like structures. We use a combination of surgical manipulations and quantitative measurements to confirm this hypothesis and provide a simple theory for this change in the shape of a doubly curved thin elastic shell subject to differential growth across its planform. Our experiments and theory overturn previous hypotheses that suggest that blooming is driven by differential growth of the inner layer of the petals and in the midrib by providing a qualitatively different paradigm that highlights the role of edge growth. This functional morphology suggests new biomimetic designs for deployable structures using boundary or edge actuation rather than the usual bulk or surface actuation.},

The relationship between gene sequence and fitness has tremendous implications for understanding both evolutionary processes and functional constraints on the encoded proteins. Here, we have exploited deep sequencing technology to experimentally determine the fitness of all possible individual point mutants under controlled conditions for a nine-amino acid region of Hsp90. Over the past five decades, limited glimpses into the relationship between gene sequence and function have sparked a long debate regarding the distribution, relative proportion, and evolutionary significance of deleterious, neutral, and advantageous mutations. Our systematic experimental measurement of fitness effects of Hsp90 mutants in yeast, evaluated in the light of existing population genetic theory, are remarkably consistent with a nearly neutral model of molecular evolution.},

title = {A biophysical protein folding model accounts for most mutational fitness  effects in viruses},
abstract = { Fitness effects of mutations fall on a continuum ranging from lethal to deleterious to beneficial. The distribution of fitness effects (DFE) among random mutations is an essential component of every evolutionary model and a mathematical portrait of robustness. Recent experiments on five viral species all revealed a characteristic bimodal shaped DFE, featuring peaks at neutrality and lethality. However, the phenotypic causes underlying observed fitness effects are still unknown, and presumably thought to vary unpredictably from one mutation to another. By combining population genetics simulations with a simple biophysical protein folding model, we show that protein thermodynamic stability accounts for a large fraction of observed mutational effects. We assume that moderately destabilizing mutations inflict a fitness penalty proportional to the reduction in folded protein, which depends continuously on folding free energy (\Delta G). Most mutations in our model affect fitness by altering \Delta G, while, based on simple estimates, \approx10% abolish activity and are unconditionally lethal. Mutations pushing \Delta G>0 are also considered lethal. Contrary to neutral network theory, we find that, in mutation/selection/drift steady-state, high mutation rates (m) lead to less stable proteins and a more dispersed DFE, i.e. less mutational robustness. Small population size (N) also decreases stability and robustness. In our model, a continuum of non-lethal mutations reduces fitness by \approx2% on average, while \approx10-35% of mutations are lethal, depending on N and m. Compensatory mutations are common in small populations with high mutation rates. More broadly, we conclude that interplay between biophysical and population genetic forces shapes the DFE. },

abstract = {Effective immunity to HIV is poorly understood. In particular, a role for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in controlling HIV is controversial. We hypothesized that significant pressure from HIV-specific ADCC would result in immune-escape variants. A series of ADCC epitopes in HIV-infected subjects to specific consensus strain HIV peptides were mapped using a flow cytometric assay for natural killer cell activation. We then compared the ADCC responses to the same peptide epitope derived from the concurrent HIV sequence(s) expressed in circulating virus. In 9 of 13 epitopes studied, ADCC antibodies were unable to recognize the concurrent HIV sequence. Our studies suggest ADCC responses apply significant immune pressure on the virus. This result has implications for the induction of ADCC responses by HIV vaccines.},

title = {The effect of linkage and population size on inbreeding depression due to mutational load},
abstract = {Using a stochastic model of a finite population in which there is mutation to partially recessive detrimental alleles at many loci, we study the effects of population size and linkage between the loci on the population mean fitness and inbreeding depression values. Although linkage between the selected loci decreases the amount of inbreeding depression, neither population size nor recombination rate have strong effects on these quantities, unless extremely small values are assumed. We also investigate how partial linkage between the loci that determine fitness affects the invasion of populations by alleles at a modifier locus that controls the selfing rate. In most of the cases studied, the direction of selection on modifiers was consistent with that found in our previous deterministic calculations. However, there was some evidence that linkage between the modifier locus and the selected loci makes outcrossing less likely to evolve; more losses of alleles promoting outcrossing occurred in runs with linkage than in runs with free recombination. We also studied the fate of neutral alleles introduced into populations carrying detrimental mutations. The times to loss of neutral alleles introduced at low frequency were shorter than those predicted for alleles in the absence of selected loci, taking into account the reduction of the effective population size due to inbreeding. Previous studies have been confined to outbreeding populations, and to alleles at frequencies close to one-half, and have found an effect in the opposite direction. It therefore appears that associations between neutral and selected loci may produce effects that differ according to the initial frequencies of the neutral alleles.},

title = {The noisy edge of traveling waves},
abstract = {Traveling waves are ubiquitous in nature and control the speed of many important dynamical processes, including chemical reactions, epidemic outbreaks, and biological evolution. Despite their fundamental role in complex systems, traveling waves remain elusive because they are often dominated by rare fluctuations in the wave tip, which have defied any rigorous analysis so far. Here, we show that by adjusting nonlinear model details, noisy traveling waves can be solved exactly. The moment equations of these tuned models are closed and have a simple analytical structure resembling the deterministic approximation supplemented by a nonlocal cutoff term. The peculiar form of the cutoff shapes the noisy edge of traveling waves and is critical for the correct prediction of the wave speed and its fluctuations. Our approach is illustrated and benchmarked using the example of fitness waves arising in simple models of microbial evolution, which are highly sensitive to number fluctuations. We demonstrate explicitly how these models can be tuned to account for finite population sizes and determine how quickly populations adapt as a function of population size and mutation rates. More generally, our method is shown to apply to a broad class of models, in which number fluctuations are generated by branching processes. Because of this versatility, the method of model tuning may serve as a promising route toward unraveling universal properties of complex discrete particle systems.},

title = {Effective size of populations under selection},
abstract = {Equations to approximate the effective size (Ne) of populations under continued selection are obtained that include the possibility of partial full-sib mating and other systems such as assortative mating. The general equation for the case of equal number of sexes and constant number of breeding individuals (N) is Ne = 4N/[2(1 - alpha I) + (Sk2 + 4Q2C2) (1 + alpha I + 2 alpha O)], where Sk2 is the variance of family size due to sampling without selection, C2 is the variance of selective advantages among families (the squared coefficient of variation of the expected number of offspring per family), alpha I is the deviation from Hardy-Weinberg proportions, alpha O is the correlation between genes of male and female parents, and Q2 is the term accounting for the cumulative effect of selection on an inherited trait. This is obtained as Q = 2/[2 - G(1 + r)], where G is the remaining proportion of genetic variance in selected individuals and r is the correlation of the expected selective values of male and female parents. The method is also extended to the general case of different numbers of male and female parents. The predictive value of the formulae is tested under a model of truncation selection with the infinitesimal model of gene effects, where C2 and G are a function of the selection intensity, the heritability and the intraclass correlation of sibs. Under random mating r = alpha I = -1/(N - 1) and alpha O = 0. Under partial full-sib mating with an average proportion beta of full-sib matings per generation, r approximately beta and alpha O approximately alpha I approximately beta/(4 - 3 beta). The prediction equation is compared to other approximations based on the long-term contributions of ancestors to descendants. Finally, based on the approach followed, a system of mating (compensatory mating) is proposed to reduce rates of inbreeding without loss of response in selection programs in which selected individuals from the largest families are mated to those from the smallest families.},

title = {Variation after a selective sweep in a subdivided population},
abstract = {The effect of genetic hitchhiking on neutral variation is analyzed in subdivided populations with differentiated demes. After fixation of a favorable mutation, the consequences on particular subpopulations can be radically different. In the subpopulation where the mutation first appeared by mutation, variation at linked neutral loci is expected to be reduced, as predicted by the classical theory. However, the effect in the other subpopulations, where the mutation is introduced by migration, can be the opposite. This effect depends on the level of genetic differentiation of the subpopulations, the selective advantage of the mutation, the recombination frequency, and the population size, as stated by analytical derivations and computer simulations. The characteristic outcomes of the effect are three. First, the genomic region of reduced variation around the selected locus is smaller than that predicted in a panmictic population. Second, for more distant neutral loci, the amount of variation increases over the level they had before the hitchhiking event. Third, for these loci, the spectrum of gene frequencies is dominated by an excess of alleles at intermediate frequencies when compared with the neutral theory. At these loci, hitchhiking works like a system that takes variation from the between-subpopulation component and introduces it into the subpopulations. The mechanism can also operate in other systems in which the genetic variation is distributed in clusters with limited exchange of variation, such as chromosome arrangements or genomic regions closely linked to targets of balancing selection.},

title = {The {NK} model of rugged fitness landscapes and its application to maturation of the immune response},
abstract = {Adaptive evolution is, to a large extent, a complex combinatorial optimization process. Such processes can be characterized as "uphill walks on rugged fitness landscapes". Concrete examples of fitness landscapes include the distribution of any specific functional property such as the capacity to catalyze a specific reaction, or bind a specific ligand, in "protein space". In particular, the property might be the affinity of all possible antibody molecules for a specific antigenic determinant. That affinity landscape presumably plays a critical role in maturation of the immune response. In this process, hypermutation and clonal selection act to select antibody V region mutant variants with successively higher affinity for the immunizing antigen. The actual statistical structure of affinity landscapes, although knowable, is currently unknown. Here, we analyze a class of mathematical models we call NK models. We show that these models capture significant features of the maturation of the immune response, which is currently thought to share features with general protein evolution. The NK models have the important property that, as the parameter K increases, the "ruggedness" of the NK landscape varies from a single peaked "Fujiyama" landscape to a multi-peaked "badlands" landscape. Walks to local optima on such landscapes become shorter as K increases. This fact allows us to choose a value of K that corresponds to the experimentally observed number of mutational "steps", 6-8, taken as an antibody sequence matures. If the mature antibody is taken to correspond to a local optimum in the model, tuning the model requires that K be about 40, implying that the functional contribution of each amino acid in the V region is affected by about 40 others. Given this value of K, the model then predicts several features of "antibody space" that are in qualitative agreement with experiment: (1) The fraction of fitter variants of an initial "roughed in" germ line antibody amplified by clonal selection is about 1-2%. (2) Mutations at some sites of the mature antibody hardly affect antibody function at all, but mutations at other sites dramatically decrease function. (3) The same "roughed in" antibody sequence can "walk" to many mature antibody sequences. (4) Many adaptive walks can end on the same local optimum. (5) Comparison of different mature sequences derived from the same initial V region shows evolutionary hot spots and parallel mutations. All these predictions are open to detailed testing by obtaining monoclonal antibodies early in the immune response and carrying out in vitro mutagenesis and adaptive hill climbing with respect to affinity for the immunizing antigen.},

title = {Viruses in the faecal microbiota of monozygotic twins and their mothers},
abstract = {Viral diversity and life cycles are poorly understood in the human gut and other body habitats. Phages and their encoded functions may provide informative signatures of a human microbiota and of microbial community responses to various disturbances, and may indicate whether community health or dysfunction is manifest after apparent recovery from a disease or therapeutic intervention. Here we report sequencing of the viromes (metagenomes) of virus-like particles isolated from faecal samples collected from healthy adult female monozygotic twins and their mothers at three time points over a one-year period. We compared these data sets with data sets of sequenced bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes and total-faecal-community DNA. Co-twins and their mothers share a significantly greater degree of similarity in their faecal bacterial communities than do unrelated individuals. In contrast, viromes are unique to individuals regardless of their degree of genetic relatedness. Despite remarkable interpersonal variations in viromes and their encoded functions, intrapersonal diversity is very low, with >95% of virotypes retained over the period surveyed, and with viromes dominated by a few temperate phages that exhibit remarkable genetic stability. These results indicate that a predatory viral-microbial dynamic, manifest in a number of other characterized environmental ecosystems, is notably absent in the very distal intestine.},

We demonstrate that the widespread capability of marine bacteria to participate in horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in coastal and oceanic environments may be the result of gene transfer agents (GTAs), viral-like particles produced by α-Proteobacteria. We documented GTA-mediated gene transfer frequencies a thousand to a hundred million times higher than prior estimates of HGT in the oceans, with as high as 47% of the culturable natural microbial community confirmed as gene recipients. These findings suggest a plausible mechanism by which marine bacteria acquire novel traits, thus ensuring resilience in the face of environmental change.},

abstract = {Two different theoretical frameworks have been developed to predict response to selection in a mixed mating population (in which reproduction occurs by a mixture of outcrossing and self-fertilization). The genotypic covariance model (GCM) and the structured linear model (SLM) rely on the same assumptions regarding quantitative trait inheritance, but use different genetic summary statistics. Here, we demonstrate the algebraic relationships between the various genetic metrics used in each theory. This is accomplished by reformulating the GCM in terms of the Wright-Kempthorne equation. We use stochastic simulations to investigate the relative accuracy of each theory for a range of selfing rates. The SLM is generally more accurate than the GCM, the most pronounced differences emerging in simulations with inbreeding depression for fitness. In fact, with strong inbreeding depression and high selfing rates, evolution can occur opposite the direction predicted by the GCM. The simulations also indicate that direct application of random mating models to partially selfing populations can produce very inaccurate predictions if quantitative trait loci exhibit dominance.},

title = {Transposable elements in natural populations with a mixture of selected and neutral insertion sites},
abstract = {This paper examines models of the population dynamics of transposable elements when chromosomal sites vary with respect to the effect on fitness of mutations caused by element insertions. Element abundance is assumed to be stabilised solely by the joint results of transposition, excision, and selection against insertional mutations. When there are only two classes of site, selected and neutral, it is hard to find parameter values for which numbers of elements are maintained that match the findings from surveys of Drosophila populations, as elements tend to accumulate at high frequencies at the neutral sites. It is similarly hard to produce realistic equilibria with three classes of site (strongly selected, weakly selected, and neutral), when elements can transpose out of the neutral sites. If transposition from neutral sites is impossible, as might be the case for elements inserted into centric heterochromatin, then realistic equilibria can be generated if there is very weak selection against elements inserted into the majority of non-neutral sites. This model predicts a modest over-representation of elements at the neutral sites. It also predicts that elements should be under-represented on the X chromosome compared with the autosomes, but this is not generally found to be the case. It is concluded that selection against insertional mutations is unlikely to be the major factor involved in the containment of element abundance.},

The feasibility of obtaining genome sequences from experimentally evolving populations offers the opportunity to investigate this relationship with new precision. Here we sequence genomes sampled through 40,000 generations from a laboratory population of Escherichia coli. Although adaptation decelerated sharply, genomic evolution was nearly constant for 20,000 generations. Such clock-like regularity is usually viewed as the signature of neutral evolution, but several lines of evidence indicate that almost all of these mutations were beneficial. This same population later evolved an elevated mutation rate and accumulated hundreds of additional mutations dominated by a neutral signature. Thus, the coupling between genomic and adaptive evolution is complex and can be counterintuitive even in a constant environment. In particular, beneficial substitutions were surprisingly uniform over time, whereas neutral substitutions were highly variable.},

title = {Lower in vivo mutation rate of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 than that predicted from the fidelity of purified reverse transcriptase},
abstract = {The level of genetic variation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a member of the lentivirus genus of the Retroviridae family, is high relative to that of retroviruses in some other genera. The high error rates of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in cell-free systems suggest an explanation for this high genetic variation. To test whether the in vivo rate of mutation during reverse transcription of HIV-1 is as high as predicted by cell-free studies, and therefore higher than that rates of mutation of retroviruses in other genera, we developed an in vivo assay for detecting forward mutations in HIV-1, using the lacZ alpha peptide gene as a reporter for mutations. This system allows the rates and types of mutations that occur during a single cycle of replication to be studied. We found that the forward mutation rate for HIV-1 was 3.4 x 10(-5) mutations per bp per cycle. Base substitution mutations predominated; G-to-A transition mutations were the most common base substitution. The in vivo mutation rates for HIV-1 are three and seven times higher than those previously reported for two other retroviruses, spleen necrosis virus and bovine leukemia virus, respectively. In contrast, our calculated in vivo mutation rate for HIV-1 is about 20-fold lower than the error rate of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, with the same target sequence. This finding indicates that HIV-1 reverse transcription in vivo is not as error prone as predicted from the fidelity of purified reverse transcriptase in cell-free studies. Our data suggest that the fidelity of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase may not accurately reflect the level of genetic variation in a natural infection.},

abstract = {Positive natural selection is the force that drives the increase in prevalence of advantageous traits, and it has played a central role in our development as a species. Until recently, the study of natural selection in humans has largely been restricted to comparing individual candidate genes to theoretical expectations. The advent of genome-wide sequence and polymorphism data brings fundamental new tools to the study of natural selection. It is now possible to identify new candidates for selection and to reevaluate previous claims by comparison with empirical distributions of DNA sequence variation across the human genome and among populations. The flood of data and analytical methods, however, raises many new challenges. Here, we review approaches to detect positive natural selection, describe results from recent analyses of genome-wide data, and discuss the prospects and challenges ahead as we expand our understanding of the role of natural selection in shaping the human genome.},

title = {High rate of recent transposable element-induced adaptation in {Drosophila} melanogaster},
abstract = {Although transposable elements (TEs) are known to be potent sources of mutation, their contribution to the generation of recent adaptive changes has never been systematically assessed. In this work, we conduct a genome-wide screen for adaptive TE insertions in Drosophila melanogaster that have taken place during or after the spread of this species out of Africa. We determine population frequencies of 902 of the 1,572 TEs in Release 3 of the D. melanogaster genome and identify a set of 13 putatively adaptive TEs. These 13 TEs increased in population frequency sharply after the spread out of Africa. We argue that many of these TEs are in fact adaptive by demonstrating that the regions flanking five of these TEs display signatures of partial selective sweeps. Furthermore, we show that eight out of the 13 putatively adaptive elements show population frequency heterogeneity consistent with these elements playing a role in adaptation to temperate climates. We conclude that TEs have contributed considerably to recent adaptive evolution (one TE-induced adaptation every 200-1,250 y). The majority of these adaptive insertions are likely to be involved in regulatory changes. Our results also suggest that TE-induced adaptations arise more often from standing variants than from new mutations. Such a high rate of TE-induced adaptation is inconsistent with the number of fixed TEs in the D. melanogaster genome, and we discuss possible explanations for this discrepancy.},

title = {The role of geography in human adaptation},
abstract = {Various observations argue for a role of adaptation in recent human evolution, including results from genome-wide studies and analyses of selection signals at candidate genes. Here, we use genome-wide SNP data from the HapMap and CEPH-Human Genome Diversity Panel samples to study the geographic distributions of putatively selected alleles at a range of geographic scales. We find that the average allele frequency divergence is highly predictive of the most extreme F(ST) values across the whole genome. On a broad scale, the geographic distribution of putatively selected alleles almost invariably conforms to population clusters identified using randomly chosen genetic markers. Given this structure, there are surprisingly few fixed or nearly fixed differences between human populations. Among the nearly fixed differences that do exist, nearly all are due to fixation events that occurred outside of Africa, and most appear in East Asia. These patterns suggest that selection is often weak enough that neutral processes -- especially population history, migration, and drift -- exert powerful influences over the fate and geographic distribution of selected alleles.},

abstract = {Making genes into gene products is subject to predictable errors, each with a phenotypic effect that depends on a normally cryptic sequence. Many cryptic sequences have strongly deleterious effects, for example when they cause protein misfolding. Strongly deleterious effects can be avoided globally by avoiding making errors (e.g., via proofreading machinery) or locally by ensuring that each error has a relatively benign effect. The local solution requires powerful selection acting on every cryptic site and so evolves only in large populations. Small populations with less effective selection evolve global solutions. Here we show that for a large range of realistic intermediate population sizes, the evolutionary dynamics are bistable and either solution may result. The local solution facilitates the genetic assimilation of cryptic genetic variation and therefore substantially increases evolvability.},

title = {Family level phylogenies reveal modes of macroevolution in RNA viruses},
abstract = {Despite advances in understanding the patterns and processes of microevolution in RNA viruses, little is known about the determinants of viral diversification at the macroevolutionary scale. In particular, the processes by which viral lineages assigned as different "species" are generated remain largely uncharacterized. To address this issue, we use a robust phylogenetic approach to analyze patterns of lineage diversification in five representative families of RNA viruses. We ask whether the process of lineage diversification primarily occurs when viruses infect new host species, either through cross-species transmission or codivergence, and which are defined here as analogous to allopatric speciation in animals, or by acquiring new niches within the same host species, analogous to sympatric speciation. By mapping probable primary host species onto family level viral phylogenies, we reveal a strong clustering among viral lineages that infect groups of closely related host species. Although this is consistent with lineage diversification within individual hosts, we argue that this pattern more likely represents strong biases in our knowledge of viral biodiversity, because we also find that better-sampled human viruses rarely cluster together. Hence, although closely related viruses tend to infect related host species, it is unlikely that they often infect the same host species, such that evolutionary constraints hinder lineage diversification within individual host species. We conclude that the colonization of new but related host species may represent the principle mode of macroevolution in RNA viruses.},

title = {Pervasive cryptic epistasis in molecular evolution},
abstract = {The functional effects of most amino acid replacements accumulated during molecular evolution are unknown, because most are not observed naturally and the possible combinations are too numerous. We created 168 single mutations in wild-type Escherichia coli isopropymalate dehydrogenase (IMDH) that match the differences found in wild-type Pseudomonas aeruginosa IMDH. 104 mutant enzymes performed similarly to E. coli wild-type IMDH, one was functionally enhanced, and 63 were functionally compromised. The transition from E. coli IMDH, or an ancestral form, to the functional wild-type P. aeruginosa IMDH requires extensive epistasis to ameliorate the combined effects of the deleterious mutations. This result stands in marked contrast with a basic assumption of molecular phylogenetics, that sites in sequences evolve independently of each other. Residues that affect function are scattered haphazardly throughout the IMDH structure. We screened for compensatory mutations at three sites, all of which lie near the active site and all of which are among the least active mutants. No compensatory mutations were found at two sites indicating that a single site may engage in compound epistatic interactions. One complete and three partial compensatory mutations of the third site are remote and lie in a different domain. This demonstrates that epistatic interactions can occur between distant (>20{\AA}) sites. Phylogenetic analysis shows that incompatible mutations were fixed in different lineages.},

abstract = {Integration into the nuclear genome of germ line cells can lead to vertical inheritance of retroviral genes as host alleles. For other viruses, germ line integration has only rarely been documented. Nonetheless, we identified endogenous viral elements (EVEs) derived from ten non-retroviral families by systematic in silico screening of animal genomes, including the first endogenous representatives of double-stranded RNA, reverse-transcribing DNA, and segmented RNA viruses, and the first endogenous DNA viruses in mammalian genomes. Phylogenetic and genomic analysis of EVEs across multiple host species revealed novel information about the origin and evolution of diverse virus groups. Furthermore, several of the elements identified here encode intact open reading frames or are expressed as mRNA. For one element in the primate lineage, we provide statistically robust evidence for exaptation. Our findings establish that genetic material derived from all known viral genome types and replication strategies can enter the animal germ line, greatly broadening the scope of paleovirological studies and indicating a more significant evolutionary role for gene flow from virus to animal genomes than has previously been recognized.},

title = {Permissive secondary mutations enable the evolution of influenza oseltamivir resistance},
abstract = {The His274-->Tyr274 (H274Y) mutation confers oseltamivir resistance on N1 influenza neuraminidase but had long been thought to compromise viral fitness. However, beginning in 2007-2008, viruses containing H274Y rapidly became predominant among human seasonal H1N1 isolates. We show that H274Y decreases the amount of neuraminidase that reaches the cell surface and that this defect can be counteracted by secondary mutations that also restore viral fitness. Two such mutations occurred in seasonal H1N1 shortly before the widespread appearance of H274Y. The evolution of oseltamivir resistance was therefore enabled by "permissive" mutations that allowed the virus to tolerate subsequent occurrences of H274Y. An understanding of this process may provide a basis for predicting the evolution of oseltamivir resistance in other influenza strains.},

title = {Understanding the evolution of defense metabolites in Arabidopsis thaliana using genome-wide association mapping},
abstract = {With the improvement and decline in cost of high-throughput genotyping and phenotyping technologies, genome-wide association (GWA) studies are fast becoming a preferred approach for dissecting complex quantitative traits. Glucosinolate (GSL) secondary metabolites within Arabidopsis spp. can serve as a model system to understand the genomic architecture of quantitative traits. GSLs are key defenses against insects in the wild and the relatively large number of cloned quantitative trait locus (QTL) controlling GSL traits allows comparison of GWA to previous QTL analyses. To better understand the specieswide genomic architecture controlling plant-insect interactions and the relative strengths of GWA and QTL studies, we conducted a GWA mapping study using 96 A. thaliana accessions, 43 GSL phenotypes, and approximately 230,000 SNPs. Our GWA analysis identified the two major polymorphic loci controlling GSL variation (AOP and MAM) in natural populations within large blocks of positive associations encompassing dozens of genes. These blocks of positive associations showed extended linkage disequilibrium (LD) that we hypothesize to have arisen from balancing or fluctuating selective sweeps at both the AOP and MAM loci. These potential sweep blocks are likely linked with the formation of new defensive chemistries that alter plant fitness in natural environments. Interestingly, this GWA analysis did not identify the majority of previously identified QTL even though these polymorphisms were present in the GWA population. This may be partly explained by a nonrandom distribution of phenotypic variation across population subgroups that links population structure and GSL variation, suggesting that natural selection can hinder the detection of phenotype-genotype associations in natural populations.},

title = {The complex genetic architecture of the metabolome},
abstract = {Discovering links between the genotype of an organism and its metabolite levels can increase our understanding of metabolism, its controls, and the indirect effects of metabolism on other quantitative traits. Recent technological advances in both DNA sequencing and metabolite profiling allow the use of broad-spectrum, untargeted metabolite profiling to generate phenotypic data for genome-wide association studies that investigate quantitative genetic control of metabolism within species. We conducted a genome-wide association study of natural variation in plant metabolism using the results of untargeted metabolite analyses performed on a collection of wild Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. Testing 327 metabolites against >200,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms identified numerous genotype-metabolite associations distributed non-randomly within the genome. These clusters of genotype-metabolite associations (hotspots) included regions of the A. thaliana genome previously identified as subject to recent strong positive selection (selective sweeps) and regions showing trans-linkage to these putative sweeps, suggesting that these selective forces have impacted genome-wide control of A. thaliana metabolism. Comparing the metabolic variation detected within this collection of wild accessions to a laboratory-derived population of recombinant inbred lines (derived from two of the accessions used in this study) showed that the higher level of genetic variation present within the wild accessions did not correspond to higher variance in metabolic phenotypes, suggesting that evolutionary constraints limit metabolic variation. While a major goal of genome-wide association studies is to develop catalogues of intraspecific variation, the results of multiple independent experiments performed for this study showed that the genotype-metabolite associations identified are sensitive to environmental fluctuations. Thus, studies of intraspecific variation conducted via genome-wide association will require analyses of genotype by environment interaction. Interestingly, the network structure of metabolite linkages was also sensitive to environmental differences, suggesting that key aspects of network architecture are malleable.},

title = {Human-specific evolution and adaptation led to major qualitative differences in the variable receptors of human and chimpanzee natural killer cells},
abstract = {Natural killer (NK) cells serve essential functions in immunity and reproduction. Diversifying these functions within individuals and populations are rapidly-evolving interactions between highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I ligands and variable NK cell receptors. Specific to simian primates is the family of Killer cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIR), which recognize MHC class I and associate with a range of human diseases. Because KIR have considerable species-specificity and are lacking from common animal models, we performed extensive comparison of the systems of KIR and MHC class I interaction in humans and chimpanzees. Although of similar complexity, they differ in genomic organization, gene content, and diversification mechanisms, mainly because of human-specific specialization in the KIR that recognizes the C1 and C2 epitopes of MHC-B and -C. Humans uniquely focused KIR recognition on MHC-C, while losing C1-bearing MHC-B. Reversing this trend, C1-bearing HLA-B46 was recently driven to unprecedented high frequency in Southeast Asia. Chimpanzees have a variety of ancient, avid, and predominantly inhibitory receptors, whereas human receptors are fewer, recently evolved, and combine avid inhibitory receptors with attenuated activating receptors. These differences accompany human-specific evolution of the A and B haplotypes that are under balancing selection and differentially function in defense and reproduction. Our study shows how the qualitative differences that distinguish the human and chimpanzee systems of KIR and MHC class I predominantly derive from adaptations on the human line in response to selective pressures placed on human NK cells by the competing needs of defense and reproduction.},

title = {Identifying signatures of natural selection in tibetan and andean populations using dense genome scan data},
abstract = {High-altitude hypoxia (reduced inspired oxygen tension due to decreased barometric pressure) exerts severe physiological stress on the human body. Two high-altitude regions where humans have lived for millennia are the Andean Altiplano and the Tibetan Plateau. Populations living in these regions exhibit unique circulatory, respiratory, and hematological adaptations to life at high altitude. Although these responses have been well characterized physiologically, their underlying genetic basis remains unknown. We performed a genome scan to identify genes showing evidence of adaptation to hypoxia. We looked across each chromosome to identify genomic regions with previously unknown function with respect to altitude phenotypes. In addition, groups of genes functioning in oxygen metabolism and sensing were examined to test the hypothesis that particular pathways have been involved in genetic adaptation to altitude. Applying four population genetic statistics commonly used for detecting signatures of natural selection, we identified selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in these two populations (Andeans and Tibetans) separately. The Tibetan and Andean patterns of genetic adaptation are largely distinct from one another, with both populations showing evidence of positive natural selection in different genes or gene regions. Interestingly, one gene previously known to be important in cellular oxygen sensing, EGLN1 (also known as PHD2), shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans. However, the pattern of variation for this gene differs between the two populations. Our results indicate that several key HIF-regulatory and targeted genes are responsible for adaptation to high altitude in Andeans and Tibetans, and several different chromosomal regions are implicated in the putative response to selection. These data suggest a genetic role in high-altitude adaption and provide a basis for future genotype/phenotype association studies necessary to confirm the role of selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in adaptation to altitude.},

abstract = {External information propagates in the cell mainly through signaling cascades and transcriptional activation, allowing it to react to a wide spectrum of environmental changes. High-throughput experiments identify numerous molecular components of such cascades that may, however, interact through unknown partners. Some of them may be detected using data coming from the integration of a protein-protein interaction network and mRNA expression profiles. This inference problem can be mapped onto the problem of finding appropriate optimal connected subgraphs of a network defined by these datasets. The optimization procedure turns out to be computationally intractable in general. Here we present a new distributed algorithm for this task, inspired from statistical physics, and apply this scheme to alpha factor and drug perturbations data in yeast. We identify the role of the COS8 protein, a member of a gene family of previously unknown function, and validate the results by genetic experiments. The algorithm we present is specially suited for very large datasets, can run in parallel, and can be adapted to other problems in systems biology. On renowned benchmarks it outperforms other algorithms in the field.},

This narrow view of evolution has become untenable in light of recent observations from genomic sequencing and population-genetic theory. Numerous aspects of genomic architecture, gene structure, and developmental pathways are difficult to explain without invoking the nonadaptive forces of genetic drift and mutation. In addition, emergent biological features such as complexity, modularity, and evolvability, all of which are current targets of considerable speculation, may be nothing more than indirect by-products of processes operating at lower levels of organization. These issues are examined in the context of the view that the origins of many aspects of biological diversity, from gene-structural embellishments to novelties at the phenotypic level, have roots in nonadaptive processes, with the population-genetic environment imposing strong directionality on the paths that are open to evolutionary exploitation.},

abstract = {Efavirenz is a second-generation nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and a common component of clinically approved anti-AIDS regimens. NNRTIs are noncompetitive inhibitors that bind in a hydrophobic pocket in the p66 subunit of reverse transcriptase (RT) ∼10 {\AA} from the polymerase active site. Hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry (HXMS) shows that efavirenz binding reduces molecular flexibility in multiple regions of RT heterodimer in addition to the NNRTI binding site. Of the 47 peptic fragments monitored by HXMS, 15 showed significantly altered H/D exchange rates in the presence of efavirenz. The slow cooperative unfolding of a β-sheet in the NNRTI binding pocket, which was previously observed in unliganded RT, is dramatically suppressed by efavirenz. HXMS also defines an extensive network of allosterically coupled sites, including four distinct regions of allosteric stabilization, and one region of allosteric destabilization. The effects of efavirenz binding extend >60 {\AA} from the NNRTI binding pocket. Allosteric changes to the structural dynamics propagate to the thumb and connection subdomains and RNase H domain of the p66 subunit as well as the thumb and palm subdomains of the p51 subunit. These allosteric regions may represent potential new drug targets.},

title = {A model for damage load and its implications for the evolution of bacterial aging},
abstract = {Deleterious mutations appearing in a population increase in frequency until stopped by natural selection. The ensuing equilibrium creates a stable frequency of deleterious mutations or the mutational load. Here I develop the comparable concept of a damage load, which is caused by harmful non-heritable changes to the phenotype. A damage load also ensues when the increase of damage is opposed by selection. The presence of a damage load favors the evolution of asymmetrical transmission of damage by a mother to her daughters. The asymmetry is beneficial because it increases fitness variance, but it also leads to aging or senescence. A mathematical model based on microbes reveals that a cell lineage dividing symmetrically is immortal if lifetime damage rates do not exceed a threshold. The evolution of asymmetry allows the lineage to persist above the threshold, but the lineage becomes mortal. In microbes with low genomic mutation rates, it is likely that the damage load is much greater than the mutational load. In metazoans with higher genomic mutation rates, the damage and the mutational load could be of the same magnitude. A fit of the model to experimental data shows that Escherichia coli cells experience a damage rate that is below the threshold and are immortal under the conditions examined. The model estimates the asymmetry level of E. coli to be low but sufficient for persisting at higher damage rates. The model also predicts that increasing asymmetry results in diminishing fitness returns, which may explain why the bacterium has not evolved higher asymmetry.},

abstract = {Understanding the prevailing mutational mechanisms responsible for human genome structural variation requires uniformity in the discovery of allelic variants and precision in terms of breakpoint delineation. We develop a resource based on capillary end sequencing of 13.8 million fosmid clones from 17 human genomes and characterize the complete sequence of 1054 large structural variants corresponding to 589 deletions, 384 insertions, and 81 inversions. We analyze the 2081 breakpoint junctions and infer potential mechanism of origin. Three mechanisms account for the bulk of germline structural variation: microhomology-mediated processes involving short (2-20 bp) stretches of sequence (28%), nonallelic homologous recombination (22%), and L1 retrotransposition (19%). The high quality and long-range continuity of the sequence reveals more complex mutational mechanisms, including repeat-mediated inversions and gene conversion, that are most often missed by other methods, such as comparative genomic hybridization, single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays, and next-generation sequencing.},

Here we present results of the pilot phase of the project, designed to develop and compare different strategies for genome-wide sequencing with high-throughput platforms. We undertook three projects: low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 179 individuals from four populations; high-coverage sequencing of two mother-father-child trios; and exon-targeted sequencing of 697 individuals from seven populations. We describe the location, allele frequency and local haplotype structure of approximately 15 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1 million short insertions and deletions, and 20,000 structural variants, most of which were previously undescribed. We show that, because we have catalogued the vast majority of common variation, over 95% of the currently accessible variants found in any individual are present in this data set. On average, each person is found to carry approximately 250 to 300 loss-of-function variants in annotated genes and 50 to 100 variants previously implicated in inherited disorders. We demonstrate how these results can be used to inform association and functional studies. From the two trios, we directly estimate the rate of de novo germline base substitution mutations to be approximately 10(-8) per base pair per generation. We explore the data with regard to signatures of natural selection, and identify a marked reduction of genetic variation in the neighbourhood of genes, due to selection at linked sites. These methods and public data will support the next phase of human genetic research.},

abstract = {Deleterious mutation poses a serious threat to human health and the persistence of small populations. Although adaptive recovery from deleterious mutation has been well-characterized in prokaryotes, the evolutionary mechanisms by which multicellular eukaryotes recover from deleterious mutation remain unknown. We applied high-throughput DNA sequencing to characterize genomic divergence patterns associated with the adaptive recovery from deleterious mutation using a Caenorhabditis elegans recovery-line system. The C. elegans recovery lines were initiated from a low-fitness mutation-accumulation (MA) line progenitor and allowed to independently evolve in large populations (N ∼ 1000) for 60 generations. All lines rapidly regained levels of fitness similar to the wild-type (N2) MA line progenitor. Although there was a near-zero probability of a single mutation fixing due to genetic drift during the recovery experiment, we observed 28 fixed mutations. Cross-generational analysis showed that all mutations went from undetectable population-level frequencies to a fixed state in 10-20 generations. Many recovery-line mutations fixed at identical timepoints, suggesting that the mutations, if not beneficial, hitchhiked to fixation during selective sweep events observed in the recovery lines. No MA line mutation reversions were detected. Parallel mutation fixation was observed for two sites in two independent recovery lines. Analysis using a C. elegans interactome map revealed many predicted interactions between genes with recovery line-specific mutations and genes with previously accumulated MA line mutations. Our study suggests that recovery-line mutations identified in both coding and noncoding genomic regions might have beneficial effects associated with compensatory epistatic interactions.},

title = {High mutation rate and predominance of insertions in the Caenorhabditis elegans nuclear genome},
abstract = {Mutations have pivotal functions in the onset of genetic diseases and are the fundamental substrate for evolution. However, present estimates of the spontaneous mutation rate and spectrum are derived from indirect and biased measurements. For instance, mutation rate estimates for Caenorhabditis elegans are extrapolated from observations on a few genetic loci with visible phenotypes and vary over an order of magnitude. Alternative approaches in mammals, relying on phylogenetic comparisons of pseudogene loci and fourfold degenerate codon positions, suffer from uncertainties in the actual number of generations separating the compared species and the inability to exclude biases associated with natural selection. Here we provide a direct and unbiased estimate of the nuclear mutation rate and its molecular spectrum with a set of C. elegans mutation-accumulation lines that reveal a mutation rate about tenfold higher than previous indirect estimates and an excess of insertions over deletions. Because deletions dominate patterns of C. elegans pseudogene variation, our observations indicate that natural selection might be significant in promoting small genome size, and challenge the prevalent assumption that pseudogene divergence accurately reflects the spontaneous mutation spectrum.},

title = {Statistical method for testing the neutral mutation hypothesis by {DNA} polymorphism},
abstract = {The relationship between the two estimates of genetic variation at the DNA level, namely the number of segregating sites and the average number of nucleotide differences estimated from pairwise comparison, is investigated. It is found that the correlation between these two estimates is large when the sample size is small, and decreases slowly as the sample size increases. Using the relationship obtained, a statistical method for testing the neutral mutation hypothesis is developed. This method needs only the data of DNA polymorphism, namely the genetic variation within population at the DNA level. A simple method of computer simulation, that was used in order to obtain the distribution of a new statistic developed, is also presented. Applying this statistical method to the five regions of DNA sequences in Drosophila melanogaster, it is found that large insertion/deletion (greater than 100 bp) is deleterious. It is suggested that the natural selection against large insertion/deletion is so weak that a large amount of variation is maintained in a population.},

title = {Exploring the effect of sex on empirical fitness landscapes},
abstract = {The nature of epistasis has important consequences for the evolutionary significance of sex and recombination. Recent efforts to find negative epistasis as a source of negative linkage disequilibrium and associated long-term advantage to sex have yielded little support. Sign epistasis, where the sign of the fitness effects of alleles varies across genetic backgrounds, is responsible for the ruggedness of the fitness landscape, with several unexplored implications for the evolution of sex. Here, we describe fitness landscapes for two sets of strains of the asexual fungus Aspergillus niger involving all combinations of five mutations. We find that approximately 30\% of the single-mutation fitness effects are positive despite their negative effect in the wild-type strain and that several local fitness maxima and minima are present. We then compare adaptation of sexual and asexual populations on these empirical fitness landscapes by using simulations. The results show a general disadvantage of sex on these rugged landscapes, caused by the breakdown by recombination of genotypes on fitness peaks. Sex facilitates movement to the global peak only for some parameter values on one landscape, indicating its dependence on the landscape's topography. We discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy between our results and the reports of faster adaptation of sexual populations.},

title = {Statistical tests of neutrality of mutations},
abstract = {Mutations in the genealogy of the sequences in a random sample from a population can be classified as external and internal. External mutations are mutations that occurred in the external branches and internal mutations are mutations that occurred in the internal branches of the genealogy. Under the assumption of selective neutrality, the expected number of external mutations is equal to theta = 4Ne mu, where Ne is the effective population size and mu is the rate of mutation per gene per generation. Interestingly, this expectation is independent of the sample size. The number of external mutations is likely to deviate from its neutral expectation when there is selection while the number of internal mutations is less affected by the presence of selection. Statistical properties of the numbers of external mutations and of internal mutations are studied and their relationships to two commonly used estimates of theta are derived. From these properties, several new statistical tests based on a random sample of DNA sequences from the population are developed for testing the hypothesis that all mutations at a locus are neutral.},

title = {Measuring the rates of spontaneous mutation from deep and large-scale polymorphism data},
abstract = {The rates and patterns of spontaneous mutation are fundamental parameters of molecular evolution. Current methodology either tries to measure such rates and patterns directly in mutation-accumulation experiments or tries to infer them indirectly from levels of divergence or polymorphism. While experimental approaches are constrained by the low rate at which new mutations occur, indirect approaches suffer from their underlying assumption that mutations are effectively neutral. Here I present a maximum-likelihood approach to estimate mutation rates from large-scale polymorphism data. It is demonstrated that the method is not sensitive to demography and the distribution of selection coefficients among mutations when applied to mutations at sufficiently low population frequencies. With the many large-scale sequencing projects currently underway, for instance, the 1000 genomes project in humans, plenty of the required low-frequency polymorphism data will shortly become available. My method will allow for an accurate and unbiased inference of mutation rates and patterns from such data sets at high spatial resolution. I discuss how the assessment of several long-standing problems of evolutionary biology would benefit from the availability of accurate mutation rate estimates.},

These "unsymmetric" equilibria, which exist for relatively loose linkage, can be explicitly obtained, in contrast to the previously known symmetric equilibria which are generally given by the solutions of a cubic equation. For sufficiently tight linkage, there is always at least one stable symmetric equilibrium. Seven is the precise maximum for the number of interior equilibria. The qualitative consequences of these results are briefly examined. In particular it is pointed out that since for some linkage values no stable polymorphic equilibria exist, there is no "overdominance theorem" comparable to the single-locus case.},

abstract = {Begun and Aquadro have demonstrated that levels of nucleotide variation correlate with recombination rate among 20 gene regions from across the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. It has been suggested that this correlation results from genetic hitchhiking associated with the fixation of strongly selected mutants. The hitchhiking process can be described as a series of two-step events. The first step consists of a strongly selected substitution wiping out linked variation in a population; this is followed by a recovery period in which polymorphism can build up via neutral mutations and random genetic drift. Genetic hitchhiking has previously been modeled as a steady-state process driven by recurring selected substitutions. We show here that the characteristic parameter of this steady-state model is alpha v, the product of selection intensity (alpha = 2Ns) and the frequency of beneficial mutations v (where N is population size and s is the selective advantage of the favored allele). We also demonstrate that the steady-state model describes the hitchhiking process adequately, unless the recombination rate is very low. To estimate alpha v, we use the data of DNA sequence variation from 17 D. melanogaster loci from regions of intermediate to high recombination rates. We find that alpha v is likely to be > 1.3 x 10(-8). Additional data are needed to estimate this parameter more precisely. The estimation of alpha v is important, as this parameter determines the shape of the frequency distribution of strongly selected substitutions.},

abstract = {The hitchhiking effect of a beneficial mutation, or a selective sweep, generates a unique distribution of allele frequencies and spatial distribution of polymorphic sites. A composite-likelihood test was previously designed to detect these signatures of a selective sweep, solely on the basis of the spatial distribution and marginal allele frequencies of polymorphisms. As an excess of linkage disequilibrium (LD) is also known to be a strong signature of a selective sweep, we investigate how much statistical power is increased by the inclusion of information regarding LD. The expected pattern of LD is predicted by a genealogical approach. Both theory and simulation suggest that strong LD is generated in narrow regions at both sides of the location of beneficial mutation. However, a lack of LD is expected across the two sides. We explore various ways to detect this signature of selective sweeps by statistical tests. A new composite-likelihood method is proposed to incorporate information regarding LD. This method enables us to detect selective sweeps and estimate the parameters of the selection model better than the previous composite-likelihood method that does not take LD into account. However, the improvement made by including LD is rather small, suggesting that most of the relevant information regarding selective sweeps is captured by the spatial distribution and marginal allele frequencies of polymorphisms.},

We here examine the extent to which linkage disequilibrium (i.e., nonrandom associations between markers) improves this discrimination. We show that patterns of linkage disequilibrium recently proposed to be unique to hitchhiking models are replicated under nonequilibrium neutral models. We also demonstrate that jointly considering spatial patterns of association among variants alongside the site-frequency spectrum is nonetheless of value. Through a comparison of models of equilibrium neutrality, nonequilibrium neutrality, equilibrium hitchhiking, nonequilibrium hitchhiking, and recurrent hitchhiking, we evaluate a linkage disequilibrium (LD) statistic (omega(max)) that appears to have power to identify regions recently shaped by positive selection. Most notably, for demographic parameters relevant to non-African populations of Drosophila melanogaster, we demonstrate that selected loci are distinguishable from neutral loci using this statistic.},

title = {Controlling the false-positive rate in multilocus genome scans for selection},
abstract = {Rapid typing of genetic variation at many regions of the genome is an efficient way to survey variability in natural populations in an effort to identify segments of the genome that have experienced recent natural selection. Following such a genome scan, individual regions may be chosen for further sequencing and a more detailed analysis of patterns of variability, often to perform a parametric test for selection and to estimate the strength of a recent selective sweep. We show here that not accounting for the ascertainment of loci in such analyses leads to false inference of natural selection when the true model is selective neutrality, because the procedure of choosing unusual loci (in comparison to the rest of the genome-scan data) selects regions of the genome with genealogies similar to those expected under models of recent directional selection. We describe a simple and efficient correction for this ascertainment bias, which restores the false-positive rate to near-nominal levels. For the parameters considered here, we find that obtaining a test with the expected distribution of P-values depends on accurately accounting both for ascertainment of regions and for demography. Finally, we use simulations to explore the utility of relying on outlier loci to detect recent selective sweeps. We find that measures of diversity and of population differentiation are more effective than summaries of the site-frequency spectrum and that sequencing larger regions (2.5 kbp) in genome-scan studies leads to more power to detect recent selective sweeps.},

title = {Detecting a local signature of genetic hitchhiking along a recombining chromosome},
abstract = {The theory of genetic hitchhiking predicts that the level of genetic variation is greatly reduced at the site of strong directional selection and increases as the recombinational distance from the site of selection increases. This characteristic pattern can be used to detect recent directional selection on the basis of DNA polymorphism data. However, the large variance of nucleotide diversity in samples of moderate size imposes difficulties in detecting such patterns. We investigated the patterns of genetic variation along a recombining chromosome by constructing ancestral recombination graphs that are modified to incorporate the effect of genetic hitchhiking. A statistical method is proposed to test the significance of a local reduction of variation and a skew of the frequency spectrum caused by a hitchhiking event. This method also allows us to estimate the strength and the location of directional selection from DNA sequence data.},

abstract = {Genome-wide patterns of variation across individuals provide a powerful source of data for uncovering the history of migration, range expansion, and adaptation of the human species. However, high-resolution surveys of variation in genotype, haplotype and copy number have generally focused on a small number of population groups. Here we report the analysis of high-quality genotypes at 525,910 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 396 copy-number-variable loci in a worldwide sample of 29 populations. Analysis of SNP genotypes yields strongly supported fine-scale inferences about population structure. Increasing linkage disequilibrium is observed with increasing geographic distance from Africa, as expected under a serial founder effect for the out-of-Africa spread of human populations. New approaches for haplotype analysis produce inferences about population structure that complement results based on unphased SNPs. Despite a difference from SNPs in the frequency spectrum of the copy-number variants (CNVs) detected--including a comparatively large number of CNVs in previously unexamined populations from Oceania and the Americas--the global distribution of CNVs largely accords with population structure analyses for SNP data sets of similar size. Our results produce new inferences about inter-population variation, support the utility of CNVs in human population-genetic research, and serve as a genomic resource for human-genetic studies in diverse worldwide populations.},

abstract = {Motivated by experiments in which a polynucleotide is driven through a proteinaceous pore by an electric field, we study the diffusive motion of a polymer threaded through a narrow channel with which it may have strong interactions. We show that there is a range of polymer lengths in which the system is approximately translationally invariant, and we develop a coarse-grained description of this regime. From this description, general features of the distribution of times for the polymer to pass through the pore may be deduced. We also introduce a more microscopic model. This model provides a physically reasonable scenario in which, as in experiments, the polymer's speed depends sensitively on its chemical composition, and even on its orientation in the channel. Finally, we point out that the experimental distribution of times for the polymer to pass through the pore is much broader than expected from simple estimates, and speculate on why this might be.},

title = {The hitch-hiking effect of a favourable gene},
abstract = {When a selectively favourable gene substitution occurs in a population, changes in gene frequencies will occur at closely linked loci. In the case of a neutral polymorphism, average heterozygosity will be reduced to an extent which varies with distance from the substituted locus. The aggregate effect of substitution on neutral polymorphism is estimated; in populations of total size 106 or more (and perhaps of 104 or more), this effect will be more important than that of random fixation. This may explain why the extent of polymorphism in natural populations does not vary as much as one would expect from a consideration of the equilibrium between mutation and random fixation in populations of different sizes. For a selectively maintained polymorphism at a linked locus, this process will only be important in the long run if it leads to complete fixation. If the selective coefficients at the linked locus are small compared to those at the substituted locus, it is shown that the probability of complete fixation at the linked locus is approximately exp (− Nc), where c is the recombinant fraction and N the population size. It follows that in a large population a selective substitution can occur in a cistron without eliminating a selectively maintained polymorphism in the same cistron.},

title = {Evolution in Sexual and Asexual Populations},
abstract = {In an asexual population two favorable mutants can be incorporated into the population only if one occurs in a descendant of the individual in which the other occurred. In a sexual population both mutants can be incorporated through recombination. A mathematical formulation is given of the relative rates of incorporation of the new mutations with and without recombination. Recombination is of the greatest advantage when the double mutant is more advantageous than either single mutant, when the mutant effects are small, when mutations occur with high frequency, and when the population is large. On the other hand, for the incorporation of individually deleterious but collectively beneficial mutations, recombination can be disadvantageous. Close linkage has effects similar to those of asexual reproduction. Experimental data on DDT resistance in Drosophila and chloramphenicol resistance in bacteria are cited showing greater development of coadaptation in an asexual system. The evolution of diploidy from haploidy confers an immediate reduction in the mutation load by concealment of deleterious recessives, but this advantage is lost once a new equilibrium is reached. Thus the development of diploidy may be because of an immediate advantage rather than because of any permanent benefit. On the other hand, there are other possible advantages of diploidy, such as heterosis and protection from somatic mutations.},

Useful summary of experiments done in kruglyak's lab
crossing of diverged yeast strains show that expression levels are determined

- only a fraction of which can be detected (typically 30% of the variance is explained
- some QTLs have large effect
the latter observation is explained by orr's exponential model of adaptation

Crosses show predominantely transgressive segregation, only some are mainly additive. they also find deviations from the parent mean, indicating recombination loads.

These "unsymmetric" equilibria, which exist for relatively loose linkage, can be explicitly obtained, in contrast to the previously known symmetric equilibria which are generally given by the solutions of a cubic equation. For sufficiently tight linkage, there is always at least one stable symmetric equilibrium. Seven is the precise maximum for the number of interior equilibria. The qualitative consequences of these results are briefly examined.

abstract = {An {HIV}-1-seropositive volunteer was infused with an expanded autologous cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clone directed against the {HIV}-1 nef protein. This clone was adoptively transferred to determine whether supplementing CTL activity could reduce viral load or improve clinical course. Unexpectedly, infusion was followed by a decline in circulating CD4+ T cells and a rise in viral load. Some of the {HIV} isolates obtained from the plasma or CD4+ cells of the patient were lacking the nef epitope. These results suggest that active CTL selection of viral variants could contribute to the pathogenesis of AIDS and that clinical progression can occur despite high levels of circulating {HIV}-1-specific CTLs.},

title = {Role of translational coupling in robustness of bacterial chemotaxis pathway},
abstract = {Chemotaxis allows bacteria to colonize their environment more efficiently and to find optimal growth conditions, and is consequently under strong evolutionary selection. Theoretical and experimental analyses of bacterial chemotaxis suggested that the pathway has been evolutionarily optimized to produce robust output under conditions of such physiological perturbations as stochastic intercellular variations in protein levels while at the same time minimizing complexity and cost of protein expression. Pathway topology in Escherichia coli apparently evolved to produce an invariant output under concerted variations in protein levels, consistent with experimentally observed transcriptional coupling of chemotaxis genes. Here, we show that the pathway robustness is further enhanced through the pairwise translational coupling of adjacent genes. Computer simulations predicted that the robustness of the pathway against the uncorrelated variations in protein levels can be enhanced by a selective pairwise coupling of individual chemotaxis genes on one mRNA, with the order of genes in E. coli ranking among the best in terms of noise compensation. Translational coupling between chemotaxis genes was experimentally confirmed, and coupled expression of these genes was shown to improve chemotaxis. Bioinformatics analysis further revealed that E. coli gene order corresponds to consensus in sequenced bacterial genomes, confirming evolutionary selection for noise reduction. Since polycistronic gene organization is common in bacteria, translational coupling between adjacent genes may provide a general mechanism to enhance robustness of their signaling and metabolic networks. Moreover, coupling between expression of neighboring genes is also present in eukaryotes, and similar principles of noise reduction might thus apply to all cellular networks.},

abstract = {The FT gene integrates several external and endogenous cues controlling flowering, including information on day length. A complex of the mobile FT protein and the bZIP transcription factor FD in turn has a central role in activating genes that execute the switch from vegetative to reproductive development. Here we reveal that microRNA156-targeted SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) genes not only act downstream of FT/FD, but also define a separate endogenous flowering pathway. High levels of miR156 in young plants prevent precocious flowering. A subsequent day length-independent decline in miR156 abundance provides a permissive environment for flowering and is paralleled by a rise in SPL levels. At the shoot apex, FT/FD and SPLs converge on an overlapping set of targets, with SPLs directly activating flower-promoting MADS box genes, providing a molecular substrate for both the redundant activities and the feed-forward action of the miR156/SPL and FT/FD modules in flowering control.},

abstract = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) by acceptor photobleaching is a simple but effective tool for measurements of protein-protein interactions. Until recently, it has been restricted to qualitative or relative assessments owing to the spectral bleed-through contamination resulting from fluorescence overlap between the donor and the acceptor. In this paper, we report a quantitative algorithm that combines the spectral unmixing technique with FRET by acceptor photobleaching. By spectrally unmixing the emissions before and after photobleaching, it is possible to resolve the spectral bleed-through and retrieve the FRET efficiency/interaction distance quantitatively. Using a human keratinocyte cell line transfected with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)- and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged Cx26 connexins as an example, FRET information at homotypic gap junctions is measured and compared with well-established methods. Results indicate that the new approach is sensitive, flexible, instrument independent and solely FRET dependent. It can achieve FRET estimations similar to that from a sensitized emission FRET method. This approach has a great advantage in providing the relative concentrations of the donor and the acceptor; this is, for example, very important in the comparative study of cell populations with variable expression levels.},

A reduction in the reaction coordinate arising from the formation of helix at low forces and an increase in the distance between consecutive phosphates of unstacked bases in the stretched state at high force in the proposed model qualitatively reproduce the experimentally observed features.

title = {Emergent gene order in a model of modular polyketide synthases},
abstract = {Polyketides are a class of biologically active heteropolymers produced by assembly line-like multiprotein complexes of modular polyketide synthases (PKS). The polyketide product is encoded in the order of the PKS proteins in the assembly line, suggesting that polyketide diversity derives from combinatorial rearrangement of these PKS complexes. Remarkably, the order of PKS genes on the chromosome follows the order of PKS proteins in the assembly line: This fact is commonly referred to as "collinearity". Here we propose an evolutionary origin for collinearity and demonstrate the mechanism by using a computational model of PKS evolution in a population. Assuming continuous evolutionary pressure for novel polyketides, and that new polyketide pathways are formed by horizontal transfer/recombination of PKS-encoding DNA, we demonstrate the existence of a broad range of parameters for which collinearity emerges spontaneously. Collinearity confers no fitness advantage in our model; it is established and maintained through a "secondary selection" mechanism, as a trait which increases the probability of forming long, novel PKS complexes through recombination. Consequently, collinearity hitchhikes on the successful genotypes which periodically sweep through the evolving population. In addition to computer simulation of a simplified model of PKS evolution, we provide a mathematical framework describing the secondary selection mechanism, which generalizes beyond the context of the present model.},

title = {Confounding between recombination and selection, and the Ped/Pop method for detecting selection},
abstract = {In recent years, there have been major developments of population genetics methods to estimate both rates of recombination and levels of natural selection. However, genomic variants subject to positive selection are likely to have arisen recently and, consequently, had less opportunity to be affected by recombination. Thus, the two processes have an intimately related impact on genetic variation, and inference of either may be vulnerable to confounding by the other. We illustrate here that even modest levels of positive selection can substantially reduce population-based recombination rate estimates. We also show that genome-wide scans to detect loci under recent selection in humans have tended to highlight loci in regions of low recombination, suggesting that confounding by recombination rate may have reduced the power of these studies. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new genome-wide approach for detecting selection, based on the ratio of pedigree-based to population-based estimates of recombination rate. Simulations suggest that our "Ped/Pop" method, which is designed to capture completed sweeps, has good power to discriminate between neutral and adaptive evolution. Unusually for a multimarker method, our approach performs well in regions of high recombination and also has good power for many generations after the fixation of an advantageous variant. We apply the method to human HapMap and Perlegen data sets, finding confirmation of reported candidates as well as identifying new loci that may have undergone recent intense selection.},

title = {A modular and extensible RNA-based gene-regulatory platform for engineering cellular function},
abstract = {Engineered biological systems hold promise in addressing pressing human needs in chemical processing, energy production, materials construction, and maintenance and enhancement of human health and the environment. However, significant advancements in our ability to engineer biological systems have been limited by the foundational tools available for reporting on, responding to, and controlling intracellular components in living systems. Portable and scalable platforms are needed for the reliable construction of such communication and control systems across diverse organisms. We report an extensible RNA-based framework for engineering ligand-controlled gene-regulatory systems, called ribozyme switches, that exhibits tunable regulation, design modularity, and target specificity. These switch platforms contain a sensor domain, comprised of an aptamer sequence, and an actuator domain, comprised of a hammerhead ribozyme sequence. We examined two modes of standardized information transmission between these domains and demonstrate a mechanism that allows for the reliable and modular assembly of functioning synthetic RNA switches and regulation of ribozyme activity in response to various effectors. In addition to demonstrating examples of small molecule-responsive, in vivo functional, allosteric hammerhead ribozymes, this work describes a general approach for the construction of portable and scalable gene-regulatory systems. We demonstrate the versatility of the platform in implementing application-specific control systems for small molecule-mediated regulation of cell growth and noninvasive in vivo sensing of metabolite production.},

title = {Breathing dynamics in heteropolymer DNA},
abstract = { While the statistical mechanical description of DNA has a long tradition, renewed interest in DNA melting from a physics perspective is nourished by measurements of the fluctuation dynamics of local denaturation bubbles by single molecule spectroscopy. The dynamical opening of DNA bubbles (DNA breathing) is supposedly crucial for biological functioning during, for instance, transcription initiation and DNA's interaction with selectively single-stranded DNA binding proteins. Motivated by this, we consider the bubble breathing dynamics in a heteropolymer DNA based on a (2+1)-variable master equation and complementary stochastic Gillespie simulations, providing the bubble size and the position of the bubble along the sequence as a function of time. We utilize new experimental data that independently obtain stacking and hydrogen bonding contributions to DNA stability. We calculate the spectrum of relaxation times and the experimentally measurable autocorrelation function of a fluorophore-quencher tagged base-pair, and demonstrate good agreement with fluorescence correlation experiments. A significant dependence of opening probability and waiting time between bubble events on the local DNA sequence is revealed and quantified for a promoter sequence of the T7 phage. The strong dependence on sequence, temperature and salt concentration for the breathing dynamics of DNA found here points at a good potential for nanosensing applications by utilizing short fluorophore-quencher dressed DNA constructs. },

Different patterns of spatial variation in selective pressures are considered, including a step change in the environment, a "pocket" in the environment and a periodically varying environment. Also, the problem of the effect of a geographic barrier to dispersal is analyzed. The results are: (1) there is a characteristic length scale of variation of gene frequencies, (see PDF). The population cannot respond to changes in environmental conditions which occur over a distance less than the characteristic length. The result does not depend either on the pattern of variation in selective pressures or on the exact shape of the dispersal function. (2) The reduction in the fitness of the heterozygote causes a cline in gene frequencies to become steeper. (3) A geographic barrier to dispersal causes a drastic change in the gene frequencies at the barrier only when almost all of the individuals trying to cross the barrier are stopped.},

title = {A statistical characterization of consistent patterns of human immunodeficiency virus evolution within infected patients},
abstract = {Within-patient {HIV} populations evolve rapidly because of a high mutation rate, short generation time, and strong positive selection pressures. Previous studies have identified "consistent patterns" of viral sequence evolution. Just before {HIV} infection progresses to AIDS, evolution seems to slow markedly, and the genetic diversity of the viral population drops. This evolutionary slowdown could be caused either by a reduction in the average viral replication rate or because selection pressures weaken with the collapse of the immune system. The former hypothesis (which we denote "cellular exhaustion") predicts a simultaneous reduction in both synonymous and nonsynonymous evolution, whereas the latter hypothesis (denoted "immune relaxation") predicts that only nonsynonymous evolution will slow. In this paper, we present a set of statistical procedures for distinguishing between these alternative hypotheses using DNA sequences sampled over the course of infection. The first component is a new method for estimating evolutionary rates that takes advantage of the temporal information in longitudinal DNA sequence samples. Second, we develop a set of probability models for the analysis of evolutionary rates in {HIV} populations in vivo. Application of these models to both synonymous and nonsynonymous evolution affords a comparison of the cellular-exhaustion and immune-relaxation hypotheses. We apply the procedures to longitudinal data sets in which sequences of the env gene were sampled over the entire course of infection. Our analyses (1) statistically confirm that an evolutionary slowdown occurs late in infection, (2) strongly support the immune-relaxation hypothesis, and (3) indicate that the cessation of nonsynonymous evolution is associated with disease progression.},

abstract = {Since recombination leads to the generation of mosaic genomes that violate the assumption of traditional phylogenetic methods that sequence evolution can be accurately described by a single tree, results and conclusions based on phylogenetic analysis of data sets including recombinant sequences can be severely misleading. Many methods are able to adequately detect recombination between diverse sequences, for example between different {HIV}-1 subtypes. More problematic is the identification of recombinants among closely related sequences such as a viral population within a host. We describe a simple algorithmic procedure that enables detection of intra-host recombinants based on split-decomposition networks and a robust statistical test for recombination. By applying this algorithm to several published {HIV}-1 data sets we conclude that intra-host recombination was significantly underestimated in previous studies and that up to one-third of the env sequences longitudinally sampled from a given subject can be of recombinant origin. The results show that our procedure can be a valuable exploratory tool for detection of recombinant sequences before phylogenetic analysis, and also suggest that {HIV}-1 recombination in vivo is far more frequent and significant than previously thought.},

title = {Evolution of complexity in signaling pathways},
abstract = {It is not clear how biological pathways evolve to mediate a certain physiological response and why they show a level of complexity that is generally above the minimum required to achieve such a response. One possibility is that pathway complexity increases due to the nature of evolutionary mechanisms. Here, we analyze this possibility by using mathematical models of biological pathways and evolutionary simulations. Starting with a population of small pathways of three proteins, we let the population evolve with mutations that affect pathway structure through duplication or deletion of existing proteins, deletion or creation of interactions among them, or addition of new proteins. Our simulations show that such mutational events, coupled with a selective pressure, leads to growth of pathways. These results indicate that pathways could be driven toward complexity via simple evolutionary mechanisms and that complexity can arise without any specific selective pressure for it. Furthermore, we find that the level of complexity that pathways evolve toward depends on the selection criteria. In general, we find that final pathway size tends to be lower when pathways evolve under stringent selection criteria. This leads to the counterintuitive conclusion that simple response requirements on a pathway would facilitate its evolution toward higher complexity.},

The principles that govern selective filtering by NPCs are not fully understood. Previous studies find that cellular proteins capable of fast translocation through NPCs (transport receptors) are characterized by a high proportion of hydrophobic surface regions. Our analysis finds that transport receptors and their complexes are also highly negatively charged. Moreover, NPC components that constitute the permeability barrier are positively charged. We estimate that electrostatic interactions between a transport receptor and the NPC result in an energy gain of several k(B)T, which would enable significantly increased translocation rates of transport receptors relative to other cellular proteins. We suggest that negative charge is an essential criterion for selective passage through the NPC.},

abstract = {The correspondence between Eigen's model of macromolecular evolution and the equilibrium statistical mechanics of an inhomogeneous Ising system is developed. The free energy landscape of random Ising systems with the Hopfield Hamiltonian as a special example is applied to the replication rate coefficient landscape. The coupling constants are scaled with 1/l, since the maxima of any landscape must not increase with the length of the macromolecules. The calculated error threshold relation then agrees with Eigen's expression, which was derived in a different way. It gives an explicit expression for the superiority parameter in terms of the parameters of the landscape. The dynamics of selection and evolution is discussed.},

title = {Ancestral Processes with Selection},
abstract = {In this paper, we show how to construct the genealogy of a sample of genes for a large class of models with selection and mutation. Each gene corresponds to a single locus at which there is no recombination. The genealogy of the sample is embedded in a graph which we call the ancestral selection graph. This graph contains all the information about the ancestry; it is the analogue of Kingman's coalescent process which arises in the case with no selection. The ancestral selection graph can be easily simulated and we outline an algorithm for simulating samples. The main goal is to analyze the ancestral selection graph and to compare it to Kingman's coalescent process. In the case of no mutation, we find that the distribution of the time to the most recent common ancestor does not depend on the selection coefficient and hence is the same as in the neutral case. When the mutation rate is positive, we give a procedure for computing the probability that two individuals in a sample are identical by descent and the Laplace transform of the time to the most recent common ancestor of a sample of two individuals; we evaluate the first two terms of their respective power series in terms of the selection coefficient. The probability of identity by descent depends on both the selection coefficient and the mutation rate and is different from the analogous expression in the neutral case. The Laplace transform does not have a linear correction term in the selection coefficient. We also provide a recursion formula that can be used to approximate the probability of a given sample by simulating backwards along the sample paths of the ancestral selection graph, a technique developed by Griffiths and Tavare (1994).},

title = {Population dependent Fourier decomposition of fitness landscapes over recombination spaces: evolvability of complex characters},
abstract = {The effect of recombination on genotypes can be represented in the form of P-structures, i.e., a map from the set of pairs of genotypes to the power set of genotypes. The interpretation is that the P-structure maps the pair of parental genotypes to the set of recombinant genotypes which result from the recombination of the parental genotypes. A recombination fitness landscape is then a function from the genotypes in a P-structure to the real numbers. In previous papers we have shown that the eigenfunctions of (a matrix associated with) the P-structure provide a basis for the Fourier decomposition of arbitrary recombination landscapes. Here we generalize this framework to include the effect of genotype frequencies, assuming linkage equilibrium. We find that the autocorrelation of the eigenfunctions of the population-weighted P-structure is independent of the population composition. As a consequence we can directly compare the performance of mutation and recombination operators by comparing the autocorrelations on the finite set of elementary landscapes. This comparison suggests that point mutation is a superior search strategy on landscapes with a low order and a moderate order of interaction p < n/3 (n is the number of loci). For more complex landscapes 1-point recombination is superior to both mutation and uniform recombination, but only if the distance among the interacting loci (defining length) is minimal. Furthermore we find that the autocorrelation on any landscape is increasing as the distribution of genotypes becomes more extreme, i.e., if the population occupies a location close to the boundary of the frequency simplex. Landscapes are smoother the more biased the distribution of genotype frequencies is. We suggest that this result explains the paradox that there is little epistatic interaction for quantitative traits detected in natural populations if one uses variance decomposition methods while there is evidence for strong interactions in molecular mapping studies for quantitative trait loci.},

title = {Specificity in protein interactions and its relationship with sequence diversity and coevolution},
abstract = {Studies of interacting proteins have found correlated evolution of the sequences of binding partners, apparently as a result of compensating mutations to maintain specificity (i.e., molecular coevolution). Here, we analyze the coevolution of interacting proteins in yeast and demonstrate correlated evolution of binding partners in eukaryotes. Detailed investigation of this apparent coevolution, focusing on the proteins' surface and binding interface, surprisingly leads to no improvement in the correlation. We conclude that true coevolution, as characterized by compensatory mutations between binding partners, is unlikely to be chiefly responsible for the apparent correlated evolution. We postulate that the correlation between sequence alignments is simply due to interacting proteins being subject to similar constraints on their evolutionary rate. Because gene expression has a strong influence on evolutionary rate, and interacting proteins will tend to have similar levels of expression, we investigated this particular constraint. We found that the absolute expression level outperformed correlated evolution for predicting interacting protein partners. A correlation between sequence alignments could also be identified not only between pairs of proteins that physically interact but also between those that are merely functionally related (i.e., within the same protein complex). This indicates that the observed correlated evolution of interacting proteins is due to similar constraints on evolutionary rate and not coevolution.},

This complete fitness investment suggests that cell behaviour could potentially mediate prezygotic isolation between microbial species, a topic about which very little is known. To investigate this possibility, we conducted individual cell mate choice trials and mass-culture mating propensity assays with isolates from sympatric natural populations of the closely related yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces paradoxus. Although we found no evidence for active species recognition in mate choice, we observed a marked difference in mating propensity between these two species. We briefly discuss the possibility that this mating propensity difference may contribute to reproductive isolation between S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus in nature.},

title = {Distinguishing {HIV}-1 drug resistance, accessory, and viral fitness mutations using conditional selection pressure analysis of treated versus untreated patient samples},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: {HIV} can evolve drug resistance rapidly in response to new drug treatments, often through a combination of multiple mutations 123. It would be useful to develop automated analyses of {HIV} sequence polymorphism that are able to predict drug resistance mutations, and to distinguish different types of functional roles among such mutations, for example, those that directly cause drug resistance, versus those that play an accessory role. Detecting functional interactions between mutations is essential for this classification. We have adapted a well-known measure of evolutionary selection pressure (Ka/Ks) and developed a conditional Ka/Ks approach to detect important interactions. RESULTS: We have applied this analysis to four independent {HIV} protease sequencing datasets: 50,000 clinical samples sequenced by Specialty Laboratories, Inc.; 1800 samples from patients treated with protease inhibitors; 2600 samples from untreated patients; 400 samples from untreated African patients. We have identified 428 mutation interactions in Specialty dataset with statistical significance and we were able to distinguish primary vs. accessory mutations for many well-studied examples. Amino acid interactions identified by conditional Ka/Ks matched 80 of 92 pair wise interactions found by a completely independent study of {HIV} protease (p-value for this match is significant: 10-70). Furthermore, Ka/Ks selection pressure results were highly reproducible among these independent datasets, both qualitatively and quantitatively, suggesting that they are detecting real drug-resistance and viral fitness mutations in the wild {HIV}-1 population. CONCLUSION: Conditional Ka/Ks analysis can detect mutation interactions and distinguish primary vs. accessory mutations in {HIV}-1. Ka/Ks analysis of treated vs. untreated patient data can distinguish drug-resistance vs. viral fitness mutations. Verification of these results would require longitudinal studies. The result provides a valuable resource for AIDS research and will be available for open access upon publication at http://www.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/{HIV}.},

abstract = {Although combination antiretroviral therapy has resulted in a considerable improvement in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV}) type 1 ({HIV}-1) infection, the emergence of resistant virus is a significant obstacle to the effective management of {HIV} infection and AIDS. We have developed a novel phenotypic drug susceptibility assay that may be useful in guiding therapy and improving long-term suppression of {HIV} replication. Susceptibility to protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors is measured by using resistance test vectors (RTVs) that contain a luciferase indicator gene and PR and RT sequences derived from {HIV}-1 in patient plasma. Cells are transfected with RTV DNA, resulting in the production of virus particles that are used to infect target cells. Since RTVs are replication defective, luciferase activity is measured following a single round of replication. The assay has been automated to increase throughput and is completed in 8 to 10 days. Test results may be useful in facilitating the selection of optimal treatment regimens for patients who have failed prior therapy or drug-naive patients infected with drug-resistant virus. In addition, the assay can be used to evaluate candidate drugs and assist in the development of new drugs that are active against resistant strains of {HIV}-1.},

title = {Natural selection on synonymous sites is correlated with gene length and recombination in Drosophila},
abstract = {Evolutionary analysis of codon bias in Drosophila indicates that synonymous mutations are not neutral, but rather are subject to weak selection at the translation level. Here we show that the effectiveness of natural selection on synonymous sites is strongly correlated with the rate of recombination, in accord with the nearly neutral hypothesis. This correlation, however, is apparent only in genes encoding short proteins. Long coding regions have both a lower codon bias and higher synonymous substitution rates, suggesting that they are affected less efficiently by selection. Therefore, both the length of the coding region and the recombination rate modulate codon bias. In addition, the data indicate that selection coefficients for synonymous mutations must vary by a minimum of one or two orders of magnitude. Two hypotheses are proposed to explain the relationship among the coding region length, the codon bias, and the synonymous divergence and polymorphism levels across the range of recombination rates in Drosophila. The first hypothesis is that selection coefficients on synonymous mutations are inversely related to the total length of the coding region. The second hypothesis proposes that interference among synonymous mutations reduces the efficacy of selection on these mutations. We investigated this second hypothesis by carrying out forward simulations of weakly selected mutations in model populations. These simulations show that even with realistic recombination rates, this interference, which we call the "small-scale" Hill-Robertson effect, can have a moderately strong influence on codon bias.},

abstract = {Natural selection optimizes an organism's genotype within the context of its environment. Adaptations to one environment can decrease fitness in another, revealing evolutionary trade-offs. Here, we show that the cost of gene expression underlies a trade-off between growth rate and mating efficiency in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. During asexual growth, mutations that eliminate the ability to mate provide an approximately 2% per-generation growth-rate advantage. Some strains, including most laboratory strains, carry an allele of GPA1 (an upstream component of the mating pathway) that increases mating efficiency by approximately 30% per round of mating at the cost of an approximately 1% per-generation growth-rate disadvantage. In addition to demonstrating a trade-off between growth rate and mating efficiency, our results illustrate differences in the selective pressures defining fitness in the laboratory versus the natural environment and show that selection, acting on the cost of gene expression, can optimize expression levels and promote gene loss.},

title = {Evidence of a novel RNA secondary structure in the coding region of {HIV}-1 pol gene},
abstract = {RNA secondary structures play several important roles in the human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV}) life cycle. To assess whether RNA secondary structure might affect the function of the {HIV} protease and reverse transcriptase genes, which are the main targets of anti-{HIV} drugs, we applied a series of different computational approaches to detect RNA secondary structures, including thermodynamic RNA folding predictions, synonymous variability analysis, and covariance analysis. Each method independently revealed strong evidence of a novel RNA secondary structure at the junction of the protease and reverse transcriptase genes, consisting of a 107-nucleotide region containing three stems, A, B, and C. First, RNA folding calculations by mfold and RNAfold both predicted the secondary structure with high confidence. Moreover, the same structure was predicted in a diverse set of reference sequences in {HIV}-1 group M, indicating that it is conserved across this group. Second, the predicted base-pairing regions displayed markedly reduced synonymous variation (approximately threefold lower than average) in a data set of 20,000 {HIV}-1 subtype B sequences from clinical samples. Third, independent analysis of covariation between synonymous mutations in this data set identified 10 covariant mutation pairs forming two diagonals that corresponded exactly to the sites predicted to base-pair in stems A and B. Finally, this structure was validated experimentally using selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation and primer extension (SHAPE). Discovery of this novel secondary structure suggests many directions for further functional investigation.},

abstract = {The H1N1 subtype of influenza A virus has caused substantial morbidity and mortality in humans, first documented in the global pandemic of 1918 and continuing to the present day. Despite this disease burden, the evolutionary history of the A/H1N1 virus is not well understood, particularly whether there is a virological basis for several notable epidemics of unusual severity in the 1940s and 1950s. Using a data set of 71 representative complete genome sequences sampled between 1918 and 2006, we show that segmental reassortment has played an important role in the genomic evolution of A/H1N1 since 1918. Specifically, we demonstrate that an A/H1N1 isolate from the 1947 epidemic acquired novel PB2 and HA genes through intra-subtype reassortment, which may explain the abrupt antigenic evolution of this virus. Similarly, the 1951 influenza epidemic may also have been associated with reassortant A/H1N1 viruses. Intra-subtype reassortment therefore appears to be a more important process in the evolution and epidemiology of H1N1 influenza A virus than previously realized.},

title = {Evolution of genetic architecture under directional selection},
abstract = {We investigate the multilinear epistatic model under mutation-limited directional selection. We confirm previous results that only directional epistasis, in which genes on average reinforce or diminish each other's effects, contribute to the initial evolution of mutational effects. Thus, either canalization or decanalization can occur under directional selection, depending on whether positive or negative epistasis is prevalent. We then focus on the evolution of the epistatic coefficients themselves. In the absence of higher-order epistasis, positive pairwise epistasis will tend to weaken relative to additive effects, while negative pairwise epistasis will tend to become strengthened. Positive third-order epistasis will counteract these effects, while negative third-order epistasis will reinforce them. More generally, gene interactions of all orders have an inherent tendency for negative changes under directional selection, which can only be modified by higher-order directional epistasis. We identify three types of nonadditive quasi-equilibrium architectures that, although not strictly stable, can be maintained for an extended time: (1) nondirectional epistatic architectures; (2) canalized architectures with strong epistasis; and (3) near-additive architectures in which additive effects keep increasing relative to epistasis.},

abstract = {Emergence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV}-1) populations that switch or broaden coreceptor usage from CCR5 to CXCR4 is intimately coupled to CD4+ cell depletion and disease progression toward AIDS. To better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the coreceptor switch, we determined the nucleotide sequences of 253 V1 to V3 env clones from 27 sequential HIV-1 subtype B isolates from four patients with virus populations that switch coreceptor usage. Coreceptor usage of clones from dualtropic R5X4 isolates was characterized experimentally. Sequence analysis revealed that 9% of the clones from CXCR4-using isolates had originated by recombination events between R5 and X4 viruses. The majority (73%) of the recombinants used CXCR4. Furthermore, coreceptor usage of the recombinants was determined by a small region of the envelope, including V3. This is the first report demonstrating that intrapatient recombination between viruses with distinct coreceptor usage occurs frequently. It has been proposed that X4 viruses are more easily suppressed by the immune system than R5 viruses. We hypothesize that recombination between circulating R5 viruses and X4 viruses can result in chimeric viruses with the potential to both evade the immune system and infect CXCR4-expressing cells. The broadening in cell tropism of the viral population to include CXCR4-expressing cells would gradually impair the immune system and eventually allow the X4 population to expand. In conclusion, intrapatient recombination between viruses with distinct coreceptor usage may contribute to the emergence of X4 viruses in later stages of infection.},

Moreover, the sites of compensatory mutations are more likely than expected by chance to be near the site of the original deleterious mutation. Furthermore, compensatory mutations tend to occur more commonly in certain regions of the protein even when controlling for clustering around the site of the deleterious mutation.

abstract = {Several well-studied promoters in yeast lose nucleosomes upon transcriptional activation and gain them upon repression, an observation that has prompted the model that transcriptional activation and repression requires nucleosome remodeling of regulated promoters. We have examined global nucleosome positioning before and after glucose-induced transcriptional reprogramming, a condition under which more than half of all yeast genes significantly change expression. The majority of induced and repressed genes exhibit no change in promoter nucleosome arrangement, although promoters that do undergo nucleosome remodeling tend to contain a TATA box. Rather, we found multiple examples where the pre-existing accessibility of putative transcription factor binding sites before glucose addition determined whether the corresponding gene would change expression in response to glucose addition. These results suggest that selection of appropriate transcription factor binding sites may be dictated to a large extent by nucleosome prepositioning but that regulation of expression through these sites is dictated not by nucleosome repositioning but by changes in transcription factor activity.},

abstract = {By comparing the low-, intermediate-, and high-frequency parts of the frequency spectrum, we gain information on the evolutionary forces that influence the pattern of polymorphism in population samples. We emphasize the high-frequency variants on which positive selection and negative (background) selection exhibit different effects. We propose a new estimator of theta (the product of effective population size and neutral mutation rate), thetaL, which is sensitive to the changes in high-frequency variants. The new thetaL allows us to revise Fay and Wu's H-test by normalization. To complement the existing statistics (the H-test and Tajima's D-test), we propose a new test, E, which relies on the difference between thetaL and Watterson's thetaW. We show that this test is most powerful in detecting the recovery phase after the loss of genetic diversity, which includes the postselective sweep phase. The sensitivities of these tests to (or robustness against) background selection and demographic changes are also considered. Overall, D and H in combination can be most effective in detecting positive selection while being insensitive to other perturbations. We thus propose a joint test, referred to as the DH test. Simulations indicate that DH is indeed sensitive primarily to directional selection and no other driving forces.},

abstract = {Natural selection on polymorphic protein-coding loci of human immunodeficiency virus-1 ({HIV}-1), the more geographically widespread of the two viruses causing human acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), was studied by estimating the rates of nucleotide substitution per site in comparisons among alleles classified in families of related alleles on the basis of a phylogenetic analysis. In the case of gag, pol, and gp41, the rate of synonymous substitution generally exceeded that of nonsynonymous substitution, indicating that these genes are subject to purifying selection. However, in the case of several of the variable (V) regions of the gp120 gene, especially V2 and V3, comparisons within and between families often showed a significantly higher rate of nonsynonymous than of synonymous nucleotide substitution. This pattern of nucleotide substitution indicates that positive Darwinian selection has acted to diversify these regions at the amino acid level. The V regions have been identified as probable epitopes for antibody recognition; therefore, avoidance of such recognition seems likely to be the basis for positive selection on these regions. By contrast, regions of {HIV}-1 proteins identified as epitopes for T cell recognition show no evidence of positive selection and are often highly conserved at the amino acid level. These results suggest that selection favoring avoidance of T cell recognition has not been a major factor in the history of {HIV}-1 and thus that avoidance of T cell recognition is not likely to be a major factor in the pathogenesis of AIDS.},

title = {The human protein coevolution network},
abstract = {Coevolution maintains interactions between phenotypic traits through the process of reciprocal natural selection. Detecting molecular coevolution can expose functional interactions between molecules in the cell, generating insights into biological processes, pathways, and the networks of interactions important for cellular function. Prediction of interaction partners from different protein families exploits the property that interacting proteins can follow similar patterns and relative rates of evolution. Current methods for detecting coevolution based on the similarity of phylogenetic trees or evolutionary distance matrices have, however, been limited by requiring coevolution over the entire evolutionary history considered and are inaccurate in the presence of paralogous copies. We present a novel method for determining coevolving protein partners by finding the largest common submatrix in a given pair of distance matrices, with the size of the largest common submatrix measuring the strength of coevolution. This approach permits us to consider matrices of different size and scale, to find lineage-specific coevolution, and to predict multiple interaction partners. We used MatrixMatchMaker to predict protein-protein interactions in the human genome. We show that proteins that are known to interact physically are more strongly coevolving than proteins that simply belong to the same biochemical pathway. The human coevolution network is highly connected, suggesting many more protein-protein interactions than are currently known from high-throughput and other experimental evidence. These most strongly coevolving proteins suggest interactions that have been maintained over long periods of evolutionary time, and that are thus likely to be of fundamental importance to cellular function.},

abstract = {Little is known about the mutational fitness effects associated with single-nucleotide substitutions on RNA viral genomes. Here, we used site-directed mutagenesis to create 91 single mutant clones of vesicular stomatitis virus derived from a common ancestral cDNA and performed competition experiments to measure the relative fitness of each mutant. The distribution of nonlethal deleterious effects was highly skewed and had a long, flat tail. As expected, fitness effects depended on whether mutations were chosen at random or reproduced previously described ones. The effect of random deleterious mutations was well described by a log-normal distribution, with -19% reduction of average fitness; the effects distribution of preobserved deleterious mutations was better explained by a beta model. The fit of both models was improved when combined with a uniform distribution. Up to 40% of random mutations were lethal. The proportion of beneficial mutations was unexpectedly high. Beneficial effects followed a gamma distribution, with expected fitness increases of 1% for random mutations and 5% for preobserved mutations.},

The method readily allows monitoring of antigenic differences among vaccine and circulating strains and thus estimation of the effects of vaccination. Further, this approach offers a route to predicting the relative success of emerging strains, which could be achieved by quantifying the combined effects of population level immune escape and viral fitness on strain evolution.},

title = {Birth of a metabolic gene cluster in yeast by adaptive gene relocation},
abstract = {Although most eukaryotic genomes lack operons, they contain some physical clusters of genes that are related in function despite being unrelated in sequence. How these clusters are formed during evolution is unknown. The DAL cluster is the largest metabolic gene cluster in yeast and consists of six adjacent genes encoding proteins that enable Saccharomyces cerevisiae to use allantoin as a nitrogen source. We show here that the DAL cluster was assembled, quite recently in evolutionary terms, through a set of genomic rearrangements that happened almost simultaneously. Six of the eight genes involved in allantoin degradation, which were previously scattered around the genome, became relocated to a single subtelomeric site in an ancestor of S. cerevisiae and Saccharomyces castellii. These genomic rearrangements coincided with a biochemical reorganization of the purine degradation pathway, which switched to importing allantoin instead of urate. This change eliminated urate oxidase, one of several oxygen-consuming enzymes that were lost by yeasts that can grow vigorously in anaerobic conditions. The DAL cluster is located in a domain of modified chromatin involving both H2A.Z histone exchange and Hst1-Sum1-mediated histone deacetylation, and it may be a coadapted gene complex formed by epistatic selection.},

abstract = {The effective size of the {HIV} population in vivo, although critically important for the prediction of appearance of drug-resistant variants, is currently unknown. To address this issue, we have developed a simple virus population model, within which the relative importance of stochastic factors and purifying selection for genetic evolution differs over, at least, three broad intervals of the effective population size, with approximate boundaries given by the inverse selection coefficient and the inverse mutation rate per base per cycle. Random drift and selection dominate the smallest (stochastic) and largest (deterministic) population intervals, respectively. In the intermediate (selection-drift) interval, random drift controls weakly diverse populations, whereas strongly diverse populations are controlled by selection. To estimate the effective size of the {HIV} population in vivo, we tested 200 pro sequences isolated from 11 {HIV}-infected patients for the presence of a linkage disequilibrium effect which must exist only in small populations. This analysis demonstrated a steady-state virus population of 10(5) infected cells or more, which is either in or at the border of the deterministic regime with respect to evolution of separate bases.},

title = {{HIV} dynamics with multiple infections of target cells},
abstract = {The high incidence of multiple infections of cells by {HIV} sets the stage for rapid {HIV} evolution by means of recombination. Yet how {HIV} dynamics proceeds with multiple infections remains poorly understood. Here, we present a mathematical model that describes the dynamics of viral, target cell, and multiply infected cell subpopulations during {HIV} infection. Model calculations reproduce several experimental observations and provide key insights into the influence of multiple infections on {HIV} dynamics. We find that the experimentally observed scaling law, that the number of cells coinfected with two distinctly labeled viruses is proportional to the square of the total number of infected cells, can be generalized so that the number of triply infected cells is proportional to the cube of the number of infected cells, etc. Despite the expectation from Poisson statistics, we find that this scaling relationship only holds under certain conditions, which we predict. We also find that multiple infections do not influence viral dynamics when the rate of viral production from infected cells is independent of the number of times the cells are infected, a regime expected when viral production is limited by cellular rather than viral factors. This result may explain why extant models, which ignore multiple infections, successfully describe viral dynamics in {HIV} patients. Inhibiting CD4 down-modulation increases the average number of infections per cell. Consequently, altering CD4 down-modulation may allow for an experimental determination of whether viral or cellular factors limit viral production.},

title = {Deriving the genomic tree of life in the presence of horizontal gene transfer: conditioned reconstruction},
abstract = {The horizontal gene transfer (HGT) being inferred within prokaryotic genomes appears to be sufficiently massive that many scientists think it may have effectively obscured much of the history of life recorded in DNA. Here, we demonstrate that the tree of life can be reconstructed even in the presence of extensive HGT, provided the processes of genome evolution are properly modeled. We show that the dynamic deletions and insertions of genes that occur during genome evolution, including those introduced by HGT, may be modeled using techniques similar to those used to model nucleotide substitutions that occur during sequence evolution. In particular, we show that appropriately designed general Markov models are reasonable tools for reconstructing genome evolution. These studies indicate that, provided genomes contain sufficiently many genes and that the Markov assumptions are met, it is possible to reconstruct the tree of life. We also consider the fusion of genomes, a process not encountered in gene sequence evolution, and derive a method for the identification and reconstruction of genome fusion events. Genomic reconstructions of a well-defined classical four-genome problem, the root of the multicellular animals, show that the method, when used in conjunction with paralinear/logdet distances, performs remarkably well and is relatively unaffected by the recently discovered big genome artifact.},

abstract = {Human cancer is caused by the accumulation of genetic alterations in cells. Of special importance are changes that occur early during malignant transformation because they may result in oncogene addiction and represent promising targets for therapeutic intervention. Here we describe a computational approach, called Retracing the Evolutionary Steps in Cancer (RESIC), to deduce the temporal sequence of genetic events during tumorigenesis from cross-sectional genomic data of tumors at their fully transformed stage. When applied to a dataset of 70 advanced colorectal cancers, our algorithm accurately predicts the sequence of APC, KRAS, and TP53 mutations previously defined by analyzing tumors at different stages of colon cancer formation. We further validate the method with glioblastoma and leukemia sample data and then apply it to complex integrated genomics databases, finding that high-level EGFR amplification appears to be a late event in primary glioblastomas. RESIC represents the first evolutionary mathematical approach to identify the temporal sequence of mutations driving tumorigenesis and may be useful to guide the validation of candidate genes emerging from cancer genome surveys.},

abstract = {The maintenance of "public" or "common good" producers is a major question in the evolution of cooperation. Because nonproducers benefit from the shared resource without bearing its cost of production, they may proliferate faster than producers. We established a synthetic microbial system consisting of two Escherichia coli strains of common-good producers and nonproducers. Depending on the population structure, which was varied by forming groups with different initial compositions, an apparently paradoxical situation could be attained in which nonproducers grew faster within each group, yet producers increased overall. We show that a simple way to generate the variance required for this effect is through stochastic fluctuations via population bottlenecks. The synthetic approach described here thus provides a way to study generic mechanisms of natural selection.},

In addition to the classical clathrin-dependent mechanism of endocytosis, several pathways that do not use a clathrin coat are emerging. These pathways transport a diverse array of cargoes and are sometimes hijacked by bacteria and viruses to gain access to the host cell. Here, we review our current understanding of various clathrin-independent mechanisms of endocytosis and propose a classification scheme to help organize the data in this complex and evolving field.},

title = {Recombination and the frequency spectrum in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans},
abstract = {Most "tests of neutrality" assess whether particular data sets depart from the predictions of a standard neutral model with no recombination. For Drosophila, where nuclear polymorphism data routinely show evidence of genetic exchange, the assumption of no recombination is often unrealistic. In addition, while conservative, this assumption is made at the cost of a great loss in power. Perhaps as a result, tests of the frequency spectrum based on zero recombination suggest an adequate fit of Drosophila polymorphism data to the predictions of the standard neutral model. Here, we analyze the frequency spectrum of a large number of loci in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans using two summary statistics. We use an estimate of the population recombination rate based on a laboratory estimate of the rate of crossing over per physical length and an estimate of the species' effective population size. In contrast to previous studies, we find that roughly half of the loci depart from the predictions of the standard neutral model. The extent of the departure depends on the exact recombination rate, but the global pattern that emerges is robust. Interestingly, these departures from neutral expectations are not unidirectional. The large variance in outcomes may be due to a complex demographic history and inconsistent sampling, or to the pervasive action of natural selection.},

title = {On the origin of species by sympatric speciation},
abstract = {Understanding speciation is a fundamental biological problem. It is believed that many species originated through allopatric divergence, where new species arise from geographically isolated populations of the same ancestral species. In contrast, the possibility of sympatric speciation (in which new species arise without geographical isolation) has often been dismissed, partly because of theoretical difficulties. Most previous models analysing sympatric speciation concentrated on particular aspects of the problem while neglecting others. Here we present a model that integrates a novel combination of different features and show that sympatric speciation is a likely outcome of competition for resources. We use multilocus genetics to describe sexual reproduction in an individual-based model, and we consider the evolution of assortative mating (where individuals mate preferentially with like individuals) depending either on an ecological character affecting resource use or on a selectively neutral marker trait. In both cases, evolution of assortative mating often leads to reproductive isolation between ecologically diverging subpopulations. When assortative mating depends on a marker trait, and is therefore not directly linked to resource competition, speciation occurs when genetic drift breaks the linkage equilibrium between the marker and the ecological trait. Our theory conforms well with mounting empirical evidence for the sympatric origin of many species.},

abstract = {The extraordinary genetic diversity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV}-1) results from the introduction of mutations by an error-prone reverse transcriptase and from recombination of the two RNA genomes packaged in the virion during the synthesis of proviral DNA. The occurrence of multiple, genetically distant {HIV}-1 subtypes and their geographic intermixing set up conditions for dramatic, rather than gradual, changes in genotype whenever genomes from different subtypes are copackaged in virions. Here we describe, for the first time, the sequential generation of multiple different, but related, intersubtype {HIV}-1 recombinants within an infected individual. Full-length gag and env genes were recovered directly from peripheral blood mononuclear cells or from primary virus cultures, using serial blood samples from a Zambian woman and a sample from her spouse. DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis established that two different A/C recombinant forms of {HIV}-1 predominated at two time points in the woman. A related but distinct recombinant {HIV}-1 was recovered from her spouse. Intersubtype recombination apparently played a central role in the evolution of {HIV}-1 in this couple and may contribute substantially to the rapid emergence of {HIV}-1 variants whenever mixed-subtype {HIV}-1 infections occur.},

We consider both a finite-length genome where the bias increases linearly with the fitness, and an infinite genome with a fixed bias. We present simulations of finite populations in a waiting time model, showing both the nonequilibrium dynamics and the equilibrium fitness distributions that are reached. We compute the equilibrium analytically in several cases, using approximate direct solution of the master equations and truncated hierarchies. ER  -},

abstract = { We introduce a quantitative measure of the capacity of a small biological network to evolve. We apply our measure to a stochastic description of the experimental setup of Guet et al. (Science 296:1466, 2002), treating chemical inducers as functional inputs to biochemical networks and the expression of a reporter gene as the functional output. We take an information-theoretic approach, allowing the system to set parameters that optimize signal processing ability, thus enumerating each network's highest-fidelity functions. We find that all networks studied are highly evolvable by our measure, meaning that change in function has little dependence on change in parameters. Moreover, we find that each network's functions are connected by paths in the parameter space along which information is not significantly lowered, meaning a network may continuously change its functionality without losing it along the way. This property further underscores the evolvability of the networks. },

title = {MULTIPLE {HIV}-1 INFECTION OF CELLS AND THE EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS OF CYTOTOXIC T LYMPHOCYTE ESCAPE MUTANTS},
abstract = {Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are an important branch of the immune system, killing virus-infected cells. Many viruses can mutate so that infected cells are not killed by CTL anymore. This escape can contribute to virus persistence and disease. A prominent example is {HIV}-1. The evolutionary dynamics of CTL escape mutants in vivo have been studied experimentally and mathematically, assuming that a cell can only be infected with one {HIV} particle at a time. However, according to data, multiple virus particles frequently infect the same cell, a process called coinfection. Here, we study the evolutionary dynamics of CTL escape mutants in the context of coinfection. A mathematical model suggests that an intermediate strength of the CTL response against the wild-type is most detrimental for an escape mutant, minimizing overall virus load and even leading to its extinction. A weaker or, paradoxically, stronger CTL response against the wild-type both lead to the persistence of the escape mutant and higher virus load. It is hypothesized that an intermediate strength of the CTL response, and thus the suboptimal virus suppression observed in {HIV}-1 infection, might be adaptive to minimize the impact of existing CTL escape mutants on overall virus load.},

abstract = {The genetic basis for three grain yield components of rice, 1000 kernel weight (KW), grain number per panicle (GN), and grain weight per panicle (GWP), was investigated using restriction fragment length polymorphism markers and F4 progency testing from a cross between rice subspecies japonica (cultivar Lemont from USA) and indica (cv. Tequing from China). Following identification of 19 QTL affecting these traits, we investigated the role of epistasis in genetic control of these phenotypes. Among 63 markers distributed throughout the genome that appeared to be involved in 79 highly significant (P < 0.001) interactions, most (46 or 73%) did not appear to have "main" effects on the relevant traits, but influenced the trait(s) predominantly through interactions. These results indicate that epistasis is an important genetic basis for complex traits such as yield components, especially traits of low heritability such as GN and GWP. The identification of epistatic loci is an important step toward resolution of discrepancies between quantitative trait loci mapping and classical genetic dogma, contributes to better understanding of the persistence of quantitative genetic variation in populations, and impels reconsideration of optimal mapping methodology and marker-assisted breeding strategies for improvement of complex traits.},

Using a simple theoretical model, we show that the rate of such transitions is drastically enhanced if the lever is bendable, e.g., at a localized hinge. Surprisingly, the transition is fastest with an intermediate flexibility of the hinge. In this intermediate regime, the transition rate is also least sensitive to the amount of "cargo" attached to the lever arm, which could be exploited by molecular motors. To explain this effect, we generalize the Kramers-Langer theory for multidimensional barrier crossing to configuration-dependent mobility matrices.},

By obtaining over four billion bases of sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide chromatin-state maps of mouse embryonic stem cells, neural progenitor cells and embryonic fibroblasts. We find that lysine 4 and lysine 27 trimethylation effectively discriminates genes that are expressed, poised for expression, or stably repressed, and therefore reflect cell state and lineage potential. Lysine 36 trimethylation marks primary coding and non-coding transcripts, facilitating gene annotation. Trimethylation of lysine 9 and lysine 20 is detected at satellite, telomeric and active long-terminal repeats, and can spread into proximal unique sequences. Lysine 4 and lysine 9 trimethylation marks imprinting control regions. Finally, we show that chromatin state can be read in an allele-specific manner by using single nucleotide polymorphisms. This study provides a framework for the application of comprehensive chromatin profiling towards characterization of diverse mammalian cell populations.},

After a brief review of the classic theory of records, which is largely restricted to sequences of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) RVs, new results for sequences of independent RVs with distributions that broaden or sharpen with time are presented. In particular, we show that when the width of the distribution grows as a power law in time n, the mean number of records is asymptotically of order ln n for distributions with a power law tail ( the Frechet class of extreme value statistics), of order ( ln n) 2 for distributions of exponential type (Gumbel class), and of order n(1)/(v+1) for distributions of bounded support (Weibull class), where the exponent. describes the behaviour of the distribution at the upper (or lower) boundary. Simulations are presented which indicate that, in contrast to the i.i.d. case, the sequence of record breaking events is correlated in such a way that the variance of the number of records is asymptotically smaller than the mean.},

abstract = {We introduce the genealogy of a random sample of genes taken from a large haploid population that evolves according to random reproduction with selection and mutation. Without selection, the genealogy is described by Kingman's well-known coalescent process. In the selective case, the genealogy of the sample is embedded in a graph with a coalescing and branching structure. We describe this graph, called the ancestral selection graph, and point out differences and similarities with Kingman's coalescent. We present simulations for a two-allele model with symmetric mutation in which one of the alleles has a selective advantage over the other. We find that when the allele frequencies in the population are already in equilibrium, then the genealogy does not differ much from the neutral case. This is supported by rigorous results. Furthermore, we describe the ancestral selection graph for other selective models with finitely many selection classes, such as the K-allele models, infinitely-many-alleles models. DNA sequence models, and infinitely-many-sites models, and briefly discuss the diploid case.},

title = {Quantitative analysis of a virulent bacteriophage transcription strategy},
abstract = {An increasingly large number of bacteriophage genomes are being sequenced each year. What is an efficient experimental and computational procedure to analyze transcription strategies of newly sequenced novel bacteriophages? We address this issue using an example of bacteriophage Xp10, which infects rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae. This phage is particularly challenging for analysis, since part of its genome is jointly transcribed by two (host and viral) RNA polymerases. To understand the roles played by the two RNA polymerases, we developed a novel method of data analysis which combines quantitative analysis of Xp10 global gene expression data and kinetic modeling of the infection process. To generalize our approach, we discuss how our method can be applied to other systems and argue that genomic array experiments combined with the methods of data analysis that we present provide an efficient way to analyze gene expression strategies of novel bacteriophages.},

title = {Divergent patterns of progression to AIDS after infection from the same source: human immunodeficiency virus type 1 evolution and antiviral responses},
abstract = {The rate of progression to AIDS in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV}-1)-infected individuals is determined by a complex series of interactions between the host and virus. Here we evaluate virologic properties and host responses in two men near-simultaneously infected with {HIV}-1 from the same sexual partner--one individual progressed to AIDS in less than 2 years, and the other remains asymptomatic 3 years postinfection. Distinct neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses were evident, with the slower progressor exhibiting generally stronger and broader responses, except for cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses early in infection. Virtually identical, homogeneous virus populations were found in both patients in the first sample obtained; however, a second unrelated {HIV}-1 virus population was also found in the fast progressor. Whether the second population emanated from an additional source of infection or the two were transmitted from the original source could not be determined. The virus population in the slower progressor turned over and diversified rapidly, whereas both virus populations in the rapid progressor evolved at a much slower rate. In addition, the character of mutational changes underlying these diversities appeared to be distinct, with a bias for diversifying selection developing in the slower progressor and a reciprocal bias towards purifying selection maintained in both populations in the fast progressor. Thus, the rapid evolution that is a hallmark of {HIV} replication may be a reflection of strong host resistance against emerging virus variants and a longer period of asymptomatic infection. Furthermore, rapid progression was not linked to a collapse of any appreciable immune response following attainment of some threshold of antigenic diversity but rather to a failure to drive this diversification and a condition of relatively unimpeded expansion of variants with optimized replicative capacity within the host.},

Here we show that global representations, on the basis of parameters that encode information about complete sequences, contain otherwise inaccessible information about the organization of sequences. By studying the spectral properties of these parameters, we demonstrate that amino acid physical properties fall into two distinct classes. One class is comprised of properties that favor sequentially localized interaction clusters. The other class is comprised of properties that favor globally distributed interactions. This observation provides a bridge between two classic models of protein folding-the collapse model and the nucleation model-and provides a basis for understanding how any degree of intermediacy between these two extremes can occur.},

abstract = {Species richness often peaks at intermediate productivity and decreases as resources become more or less abundant. The mechanisms that produce this pattern are not completely known, but several previous studies have suggested environmental heterogeneity as a cause. In experiments with evolving digital organisms and populations of fixed size, maximum species richness emerges at intermediate productivity, even in a spatially homogeneous environment, owing to frequency-dependent selection to exploit an influx of mixed resources. A diverse pool of limiting resources is sufficient to cause adaptive radiation, which is manifest by the origin and maintenance of phenotypically and phylogenetically distinct groups of organisms.},

abstract = {Vertebrate ancestors appeared in a uniform, shallow water environment, but modern species flourish in highly variable niches. A striking array of phenotypes exhibited by contemporary animals is assumed to have evolved by accumulating a series of selectively advantageous mutations. However, the experimental test of such adaptive events at the molecular level is remarkably difficult. One testable phenotype, dim-light vision, is mediated by rhodopsins. Here, we engineered 11 ancestral rhodopsins and show that those in early ancestors absorbed light maximally (lambda(max)) at 500 nm, from which contemporary rhodopsins with variable lambda(max)s of 480-525 nm evolved on at least 18 separate occasions. These highly environment-specific adaptations seem to have occurred largely by amino acid replacements at 12 sites, and most of those at the remaining 191 ( approximately 94%) sites have undergone neutral evolution. The comparison between these results and those inferred by commonly-used parsimony and Bayesian methods demonstrates that statistical tests of positive selection can be misleading without experimental support and that the molecular basis of spectral tuning in rhodopsins should be elucidated by mutagenesis analyses using ancestral pigments.},

Using publicly available genetic markers, we have constructed a first-generation haplotype map of chromosome 19. As expected for this marker density, approximately one-third of the chromosome is encompassed within haplotype blocks. Evolutionary modeling of the data indicates that recombination hot spots are not required to explain most of the observed blocks, providing that marker ascertainment and the observed marker spacing are considered. In contrast, several long blocks are inconsistent with our evolutionary models, and different mechanisms could explain their origins.},

title = {Why Does the Genotype Not Congeal?},
abstract = {1) When we consider two or more loci, the degree of overlap of generations affects our forecast of the way in which a population will evolve. With completely over-lapping generations there is no tendency for loci which do not interact epistatically at the phenetic level to develop gametic excess (linkage disequilibrium). With non-overlapping generations, such loci do tend to develop gametic excess, but only if they are closely linked and selection is strong. In all generation systems loci which interact epistatically at the phenetic level tend to develop gametic excess. Epistatic interaction is probably common. 2) The equation which describes changes of fitness in a population polymorphic for two loci predicts that, at stable equilibria, selection will favor closer linkage between loci which have gametic excess. 3) This raises the question why recombination still occurs, or why all organisms are not as some Oenothera species, with a condensed genotype. 4) The fitness equation for three loci shows that, in contrast to the predictions with two loci, fitness will sometimes decrease when linkage becomes tighter. As this effect grows stronger the greater the number of loci, it prevents condensation of the genotype, and keeps recombination at an optimum.},

title = {Sex and the evolution of intrahost competition in RNA virus phi6},
abstract = {Sex allows beneficial mutations that occur in separate lineages to be fixed in the same genome. For this reason, the Fisher-Muller model predicts that adaptation to the environment is more rapid in a large sexual population than in an equally large asexual population. Sexual reproduction occurs in populations of the RNA virus phi6 when multiple bacteriophages coinfect the same host cell. Here, we tested the model's predictions by determining whether sex favors more rapid adaptation of phi6 to a bacterial host, Pseudomonas phaseolicola. Replicate populations of phi6 were allowed to evolve in either the presence or absence of sex for 250 generations. All experimental populations showed a significant increase in fitness relative to the ancestor, but sex did not increase the rate of adaptation. Rather, we found that the sexual and asexual treatments also differ because intense intrahost competition between viruses occurs during coinfection. Results showed that the derived sexual viruses were selectively favored only when coinfection is common, indicating that within-host competition detracts from the ability of viruses to exploit the host. Thus, sex was not advantageous because the cost created by intrahost competition was too strong. Our findings indicate that high levels of coinfection exceed an optimum where sex may be beneficial to populations of phi6, and suggest that genetic conflicts can evolve in RNA viruses.},

We have developed a method to determine G and k that utilizes two donor-acceptor fusion proteins with differing FRET efficiencies - the value of which need not be known. We validated the method by measuring the FRET efficiency and concentration ratio of the fluorescent proteins Cerulean and Venus in mammalian cells expressing a series of fusion proteins with varying stoichiometries. The method greatly simplifies quantitative FRET measurement in living cells as it does not require cell fixation, acceptor photobleaching, protein purification, or specialized equipment for determining fluorescence spectra or lifetime.},

abstract = {We report a complex set of scaling relationships between mutation and reproduction in a simple model of a population. These follow from a consideration of patterns of genetic diversity in a sample of DNA sequences. Five different possible limit processes, each with a different scaled mutation parameter, can be used to describe genetic diversity in a large population. Only one of these corresponds to the usual population genetic model, and the others make drastically different predictions about genetic diversity. The complexity arises because individuals can potentially have very many offspring. To the extent that this occurs in a given species, our results imply that inferences from genetic data made under the usual assumptions are likely to be wrong. Our results also uncover a fundamental difference between populations in which generations are overlapping and those in which generations are discrete. We choose one of the five limit processes that appears to be appropriate for some marine organisms and use a sample of genetic data from a population of Pacific oysters to infer the parameters of the model. The data suggest the presence of rare reproduction events in which approximately 8% of the population is replaced by the offspring of a single individual.},

abstract = {We study the transient dynamics of the genotypic variance of an additive trait under stabilizing selection, recombination and random drift. We show how interaction of these factors determines the form and the rates of change of different components of the genotypic variance. Let Vg be the genic variance of the trait and CL be the contribution of linkage disequilibrium to the genotypic variance. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the system on the plane (Vg, CL) are typically characterized by a quick approach to a straight line with slow evolution along this line afterwards. We show that the number of loci, n, and the population size, N, affect the expected dynamics of Vg mainly through the ratio N/n. We use our analytical and numerical results in interpreting the published results of artificial stabilizing selection experiments. The analysis suggests that it is drift and not selection that most likely led to the reduction of genetic variability in most of these experiments. Even very strong stabilizing selection only slowly removes polygenic variability from populations.},

abstract = {In Arabidopsis thaliana, four different dicer-like (DCL) proteins have distinct but partially overlapping functions in the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) and siRNAs from longer, noncoding precursor RNAs. To analyze the impact of different components of the small RNA biogenesis machinery on the transcriptome, we subjected dcl and other mutants impaired in small RNA biogenesis to whole-genome tiling array analysis. We compared both protein-coding genes and noncoding transcripts, including most pri-miRNAs, in two tissues and several stress conditions. Our analysis revealed a surprising number of common targets in dcl1 and dcl2 dcl3 dcl4 triple mutants. Furthermore, our results suggest that the DCL1 is not only involved in miRNA action but also contributes to silencing of a subset of transposons, apparently through an effect on DNA methylation.},

abstract = {Adaptive protein evolution is pervasive in Drosophila. Genomic studies, thus far, have analyzed each protein as a single entity. However, the targets of adaptive events may be localized to particular parts of proteins, such as protein domains or regions involved in protein folding. We compared the population genetic mechanisms driving sequence polymorphism and divergence in defined protein domains and non-domain regions. Interestingly, we find that non-domain regions of proteins are more frequent targets of directional selection. Protein domains are also evolving under directional selection, but appear to be under stronger purifying selection than non-domain regions. Non-domain regions of proteins clearly play a major role in adaptive protein evolution on a genomic scale and merit future investigations of their functional properties.},

This framework forms the basis of many multilevel selection models and is also frequently used to model evolutionary dynamics on networks. Kin selection, which was initially restricted to describe social interactions between relatives, has also led to a broader mathematical approach, inclusive fitness, that can not only describe social evolution among relatives, but also in group structured populations or on social networks. It turns out that the underlying mathematics of game theory is fundamentally different from the approach of inclusive fitness. Thus, both approaches-evolutionary game theory and inclusive fitness-can be helpful to understand the evolution of social traits in group structured or spatially extended populations.},

title = {Modeling linkage disequilibrium and identifying recombination hotspots using single-nucleotide polymorphism data},
abstract = {We introduce a new statistical model for patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) among multiple SNPs in a population sample. The model overcomes limitations of existing approaches to understanding, summarizing, and interpreting LD by (i) relating patterns of LD directly to the underlying recombination process; (ii) considering all loci simultaneously, rather than pairwise; (iii) avoiding the assumption that LD necessarily has a "block-like" structure; and (iv) being computationally tractable for huge genomic regions (up to complete chromosomes). We examine in detail one natural application of the model: estimation of underlying recombination rates from population data. Using simulation, we show that in the case where recombination is assumed constant across the region of interest, recombination rate estimates based on our model are competitive with the very best of current available methods. More importantly, we demonstrate, on real and simulated data, the potential of the model to help identify and quantify fine-scale variation in recombination rate from population data. We also outline how the model could be useful in other contexts, such as in the development of more efficient haplotype-based methods for LD mapping.},

A genome-wide search identified sequence variants in the 4p16.3 region correlated with recombination rate in both males and females. These variants are located in the RNF212 gene, a putative ortholog of the ZHP-3 gene that is essential for recombinations and chiasma formation in Caenorhabditis elegans. It is noteworthy that the haplotype formed by two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the highest recombination rate in males is associated with a low recombination rate in females. Consequently, if the frequency of the haplotype changes, the average recombination rate will increase for one sex and decrease for the other, but the sex-averaged recombination rate of the population can stay relatively constant.},

title = {Epistasis of quantitative trait loci under different gene action models},
abstract = {Modeling and detecting nonallelic (epistatic) effects at multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL) often assume that the study population is in zygotic equilibrium (i.e., genotypic frequencies at different loci are products of corresponding single-locus genotypic frequencies). However, zygotic associations can arise from physical linkages between different loci or from many evolutionary and demographic processes even for unlinked loci. We describe a new model that partitions the two-locus genotypic values in a zygotic disequilibrium population into equilibrium and residual portions. The residual portion is of course due to the presence of zygotic associations. The equilibrium portion has eight components including epistatic effects that can be defined under three commonly used equilibrium models, Cockerham's model, F2-metric, and F(infinity)-metric models. We evaluate our model along with these equilibrium models theoretically and empirically. While all the equilibrium models require zygotic equilibrium, Cockerham's model is the most general, allowing for Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium and arbitrary gene frequencies at individual loci whereas F2-metric and F(infinity)-metric models require gene frequencies of one-half in a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium population. In an F2 population with two unlinked loci, Cockerham's model is reduced to the F2-metric model and thus both have a desirable property of orthogonality among the genic effects; the genic effects under the F(infinity)-metric model are not orthogonal but they can be easily translated into those under the F2-metric model through a simple relation. Our model is reduced to these equilibrium models in the absence of zygotic associations. The results from our empirical analysis suggest that the residual genetic variance arising from zygotic associations can be substantial and may be an important source of bias in QTL mapping studies.},

abstract = {The fixation of weakly selected mutations can be greatly influenced by strong directional selection at linked loci. Here, I investigate a two-locus model in which weakly selected, reversible mutations occur at one locus and recurrent strong directional selection occurs at the other locus. This model is analogous to selection on codon usage at synonymous sites linked to nonsynonymous sites under strong directional selection. Two approximations obtained here describe the expected frequency of the weakly selected preferred alleles at equilibrium. These approximations, as well as simulation results, show that the level of codon bias declines with an increasing rate of substitution at the strongly selected locus, as expected from the well-understood theory that selection at one locus reduces the efficacy of selection at linked loci. These solutions are used to examine whether the negative correlation between codon bias and nonsynonymous substitution rates recently observed in Drosophila can be explained by this hitchhiking effect. It is shown that this observation can be reasonably well accounted for if a large fraction of the nonsynonymous substitutions on genes in the data set are driven by strong directional selection.},

title = {Interactions between natural selection, recombination and gene density in the genes of Drosophila},
abstract = {In Drosophila, as in many organisms, natural selection leads to high levels of codon bias in genes that are highly expressed. Thus codon bias is an indicator of the intensity of one kind of selection that is experienced by genes and can be used to assess the impact of other genomic factors on natural selection. Among 13,000 genes in the Drosophila genome, codon bias has a slight positive, and strongly significant, association with recombination--as expected if recombination allows natural selection to act more efficiently when multiple linked sites segregate functional variation. The same reasoning leads to the expectation that the efficiency of selection, and thus average codon bias, should decline with gene density. However, this prediction is not confirmed. Levels of codon bias and gene expression are highest for those genes in an intermediate range of gene density, a pattern that may be the result of a tradeoff between the advantages for gene expression of close gene spacing and disadvantages arising from regulatory conflicts among tightly packed genes. These factors appear to overlay the more subtle effect of linkage among selected sites that gives rise to the association between recombination rate and codon bias.},

abstract = {alpha-Synuclein is a primarily neuronal protein that is enriched at the pre-synapse. alpha-Synuclein and the microtubule binding protein tau have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. alpha-Synuclein is known to associate with phospholipid vesicles, regulates dopamine metabolism and exhibits chaperone activity, but its main role remains largely unknown. Furthermore, knowledge on its interactions and post-translational modifications is essential for a molecular understanding of alpha-synucleinopathies. We investigated alpha-synuclein mutations, causative for autosomal dominant forms of Parkinson's disease (A30P, A53T and E46K), and phosphorylation mutants at serine 129 (S129A and S129D) using fluorescently labelled alpha-synuclein, actin and tau. The investigation of colocalization, and protein-protein interactions by F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer and fluorescence lifetime imaging showed that alpha-synuclein associates with the actin cytoskeleton and interacts with tau. The A30P mutation and cytoskeletal destabilization decreased this interaction. Given the concurrent loss of membrane binding by this mutation, we propose a membrane-bound functional complex with tau that might involve the actin cytoskeleton.},

title = {A general model for the evolution of recombination},
abstract = {A general representation of multilocus selection is extended to allow recombination to depend on genotype. The equations simplify if modifier alleles have small effects on recombination. The evolution of such modifiers only depends on how they alter recombination between the selected loci, and does not involve dominance in modifier effects. The net selection on modifiers can be found explicitly if epistasis is weak relative to recombination. This analysis shows that recombination can be favoured in two ways: because it impedes the response to epistasis which fluctuates in sign, or because it facilitates the response to directional selection. The first mechanism is implausible, because epistasis must change sign over periods of a few generations: faster or slower fluctuations favour reduced recombination. The second mechanism requires weak negative epistasis between favourable alleles, which may either be increasing, or held in check by mutation. The selection (si) on recombination modifiers depends on the reduction in additive variance of log(fitness) due to linkage disequilibria (v1 < O), and on non-additive variance in log(fitness) (V'2, V'3.. for epistasis between 2, 3.. loci). For unlinked loci and pairwise epistasis, si = --(v1 +4V2/3)deltar, where deltar is the average increase in recombination caused by the modifier. The approximations are checked against exact calculations for three loci, and against Charlesworth's analyses of mutation/selection balance (1990), and directional selection (1993). The analysis demonstrates a general relation between selection on recombination and observable components of fitness variation, which is open to experimental test.},

title = {Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities in protein evolution},
abstract = {We study fitness landscape in the space of protein sequences by relating sets of human pathogenic missense mutations in 32 proteins to amino acid substitutions that occurred in the course of evolution of these proteins. On average, approximately 10% of deviations of a nonhuman protein from its human ortholog are compensated pathogenic deviations (CPDs), i.e., are caused by an amino acid substitution that, at this site, would be pathogenic to humans. Normal functioning of a CPD-containing protein must be caused by other, compensatory deviations of the nonhuman species from humans. Together, a CPD and the corresponding compensatory deviation form a Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility that can be visualized as the corner on a fitness ridge. Thus, proteins evolve along fitness ridges which contain only approximately 10 steps between successive corners. The fraction of CPDs among all deviations of a protein from its human ortholog does not increase with the evolutionary distance between the proteins, indicating that substitutions that carry evolving proteins around these corners occur in rapid succession, driven by positive selection. Data on fitness of interspecies hybrids suggest that the compensatory change that makes a CPD fit usually occurs within the same protein. Data on protein structures and on cooccurrence of amino acids at different sites of multiple orthologous proteins often make it possible to provisionally identify the substitution that compensates a particular CPD.},

title = {The rate at which asexual populations cross fitness valleys},
abstract = {Complex traits often involve interactions between different genetic loci. This can lead to sign epistasis, whereby mutations that are individually deleterious or neutral combine to confer a fitness benefit. In order to acquire the beneficial genotype, an asexual population must cross a fitness valley or plateau by first acquiring the deleterious or neutral intermediates. Here, we present a complete, intuitive theoretical description of the valley-crossing process across the full spectrum of possible parameter regimes. We calculate the rate at which a population crosses a fitness valley or plateau of arbitrary width, as a function of the mutation rates, the population size, and the fitnesses of the intermediates. We find that when intermediates are close to neutral, a large population can cross even wide fitness valleys remarkably quickly, so that valley-crossing dynamics may be common even when mutations that directly increase fitness are also possible. Thus the evolutionary dynamics of large populations can be sensitive to the structure of an extended region of the fitness landscape - the population may not take directly uphill paths in favor of paths across valleys and plateaus that lead eventually to fitter genotypes. In smaller populations, we find that below a threshold size, which depends on the width of the fitness valley and the strength of selection against intermediate genotypes, valley-crossing is much less likely and hence the evolutionary dynamics are less influenced by distant regions of the fitness landscape.},

title = {Evidence for mutation showers},
abstract = {Mutants in the Big Blue transgenic mouse system show spontaneous clustered multiple mutations with unexpectedly high frequency, consistent with chronocoordinate events. We tested the prediction that the multiple mutations seen within the lacI mutation target sometimes occur in the context of chronocoordinate multiple mutations spanning multiple kilobases (mutation showers). Additional sequencing of mutants was performed in regions immediately flanking the lacI region (total of 10.7 kb). Nineteen additional mutations were found outside the lacI region ("ectomutations") from 10 mutants containing two or more lacI mutations, whereas only one ectomutation was found in 130 mutants with a single mutation (P < 0.0001). The mutation showers had an average of approximately one mutation per 3 kb. Four mutants showed closely spaced double mutations in the new sequence, and analysis of the spacing between these mutations revealed significant clustering (P = 0.0098). To determine the extent of the mutation showers, regions (8.5 kb total) remote from the lacI region (approximately 16-17 kb away) were sequenced. Only two additional ectomutations were found in these remote regions, consistent with mutation showers that generally do not extend more than approximately 30 kb. We conclude that mutation showers exist and that they constitute at least 0.2% and possibly 1% or more of mutational events observed in this system. The existence of mutation showers has implications for oncogenesis and evolution, raising the possibilities of "cancer in an instant" and "introns as sponges to reduce the deleterious impact of mutation showers."},

It has been studied by two different approaches: mutation accumulation and mutagenesis experiments, and the analysis of DNA sequence data. The proportion of mutations that are advantageous, effectively neutral and deleterious varies between species, and the DFE differs between coding and non-coding DNA. Despite these differences between species and genomic regions, some general principles have emerged: advantageous mutations are rare, and those that are strongly selected are exponentially distributed; and the DFE of deleterious mutations is complex and multi-modal.},

title = {The distribution of surviving blocks of an ancestral genome},
abstract = {What is the chance that some part of a stretch of genome will survive? In a population of constant size, and with no selection, the probability of survival of some part of a stretch of map length y < 1 approaches y/log(yt/2) for log(yt) > or = 1. Thus, the whole genome is certain to be lost, but the rate of loss is extremely slow. This solution extends to give the whole distribution of surviving block sizes as a function of time. We show that the expected number of blocks at time t is 1+yt and give expressions for the moments of the number of blocks and the total amount of genome that survives for a given time. The solution is based on a branching process and assumes complete interference between crossovers, so that each descendant carries only a single block of ancestral material. We consider cases where most individuals carry multiple blocks, either because there are multiple crossovers in a long genetic map, or because enough time has passed that most individuals in the population are related to each other. For species such as ours, which have a long genetic map, the genome of any individual which leaves descendants (approximately 80% of the population for a Poisson offspring number with mean two) is likely to persist for an extremely long time, in the form of a few short blocks of genome.},

abstract = {Much recent work has explored molecular and population-genetic constraints on the rate of protein sequence evolution. The best predictor of evolutionary rate is expression level, for reasons that have remained unexplained. Here, we hypothesize that selection to reduce the burden of protein misfolding will favor protein sequences with increased robustness to translational missense errors. Pressure for translational robustness increases with expression level and constrains sequence evolution. Using several sequenced yeast genomes, global expression and protein abundance data, and sets of paralogs traceable to an ancient whole-genome duplication in yeast, we rule out several confounding effects and show that expression level explains roughly half the variation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein evolutionary rates. We examine causes for expression's dominant role and find that genome-wide tests favor the translational robustness explanation over existing hypotheses that invoke constraints on function or translational efficiency. Our results suggest that proteins evolve at rates largely unrelated to their functions and can explain why highly expressed proteins evolve slowly across the tree of life.},

abstract = {The role of epistasis in evolution and speciation has remained controversial. We use a new parameterization of physiological epistasis to examine the effects of epistasis on levels of additive genetic Variance during a population bottleneck. We found that all forms of epistasis increase average additive generic variance in finite populations derived from initial populations with intermediate allele frequencies. Average additive variance continues to increase over many generations, especially Lit larger population sizes (N = 32 to 64). Additive-by-additive epistasis is the most potent source of additive genetic variance in this situation, whereas dominance-by-dominance epistasis contributes smaller amounts of additive genetic variance. With additive-by-dominance epistasis, additive genetic variance decreases at a relatively high rate immediately after a population bottleneck, rebounding to higher levels after several generations. Empirical examples of epistasis for murine adult body weight based on measured genotypes are provided illustrating the varying effects of epistasis on additive genetic variance during population bottlenecks.},

abstract = {Investigation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV}-1) in the genital tract of women is crucial to the development of vaccines and therapies. Previous analyses of {HIV}-1 in various anatomic sites have documented compartmentalization, with viral sequences from each location that were distinct yet phylogenetically related. Full-length RNA genomes derived from different compartments in the same individual, however, have not yet been studied. Furthermore, although there is evidence that intrapatient recombination may occur frequently, recombinants comprising viruses from different sites within one individual have rarely been documented. We compared full-length {HIV}-1 RNA sequences in the plasma and female genital tract, focusing on a woman with high {HIV}-1 RNA loads in each compartment who had been infected heterosexually and then transmitted {HIV}-1 by the same route. We cloned and sequenced 10 full-length {HIV}-1 RNA genomes from her genital tract and 10 from her plasma. We also compared viral genomes from the genital tract and plasma of four additional heterosexually infected women, sequencing 164 env and gag clones obtained from the two sites. Four of five women, including the one whose complete viral sequences were determined, displayed compartmentalized {HIV}-1 genomes. Analyses of full-length, compartmentalized sequences made it possible to document complex intrapatient {HIV}-1 recombinants that were composed of alternating viral sequences characteristic of each site. These findings demonstrate that the genital tract and blood harbor genetically distinct populations of replicating {HIV}-1 and provide evidence that recombination between strains from the two compartments contributes to rapid evolution of viral sequence variation in infected individuals.},

abstract = {Current methods for inferring population structure from genetic data do not provide formal significance tests for population differentiation. We discuss an approach to studying population structure (principal components analysis) that was first applied to genetic data by Cavalli-Sforza and colleagues. We place the method on a solid statistical footing, using results from modern statistics to develop formal significance tests. We also uncover a general "phase change" phenomenon about the ability to detect structure in genetic data, which emerges from the statistical theory we use, and has an important implication for the ability to discover structure in genetic data: for a fixed but large dataset size, divergence between two populations (as measured, for example, by a statistic like FST) below a threshold is essentially undetectable, but a little above threshold, detection will be easy. This means that we can predict the dataset size needed to detect structure.},

abstract = {The genetic variation that occurs naturally in a population is a powerful resource for studying how genotype affects phenotype. Each allele is a perturbation of the biological system, and genetic crosses, through the processes of recombination and segregation, randomize the distribution of these alleles among the progeny of a cross. The randomized genetic perturbations affect traits directly and indirectly, and the similarities and differences between traits in their responses to common perturbations allow inferences about whether variation in a trait is a cause of a phenotype (such as disease) or whether the trait variation is, instead, an effect of that phenotype. It is then possible to use this information about causes and effects to build models of probabilistic 'causal networks'. These networks are beginning to define the outlines of the 'genotype-phenotype map'.},

title = {Pleiotropic models of quantitative variation},
abstract = {It is widely held that each gene typically affects many characters, and that each character is affected by many genes. Moreover, strong stabilizing selection cannot act on an indefinitely large number of independent traits. This makes it likely that heritable variation in any one trait is maintained as a side effect of polymorphisms which have nothing to do with selection on that trait. This paper examines the idea that variation is maintained as the pleiotropic side effect of either deleterious mutation, or balancing selection. If mutation is responsible, it must produce alleles which are only mildly deleterious (s approximately 10(-3)), but nevertheless have significant effects on the trait. Balancing selection can readily maintain high heritabilities; however, selection must be spread over many weakly selected polymorphisms if large responses to artificial selection are to be possible. In both classes of pleiotropic model, extreme phenotypes are less fit, giving the appearance of stabilizing selection on the trait. However, it is shown that this effect is weak (of the same order as the selection on each gene): the strong stabilizing selection which is often observed is likely to be caused by correlations with a limited number of directly selected traits. Possible experiments for distinguishing the alternatives are discussed.},

abstract = {The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used by humans for millennia to make wine, beer and bread. More recently, it became a key model organism for studies of eukaryotic biology and for genomic analysis. However, relatively little is known about the natural lifestyle and population genetics of yeast. One major question is whether genetically diverse yeast strains mate and recombine in the wild. We developed a method to infer the evolutionary history of a species from genome sequences of multiple individuals and applied it to whole-genome sequence data from three strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the sister species Saccharomyces paradoxus. We observed a pattern of sequence variation among yeast strains in which ancestral recombination events lead to a mosaic of segments with shared genealogy. Based on sequence divergence and the inferred median size of shared segments (approximately 2,000 bp), we estimated that although any two strains have undergone approximately 16 million cell divisions since their last common ancestor, only 314 outcrossing events have occurred during this time (roughly one every 50,000 divisions). Local correlations in polymorphism rates indicate that linkage disequilibrium in yeast should extend over kilobases. Our results provide the initial foundation for population studies of association between genotype and phenotype in S. cerevisiae.},

abstract = {Most {HIV} replication occurs in solid lymphoid tissue, which has prominent architecture at the histological level, which separates groups of productively infected CD4(+) cells. Nevertheless, current population models of {HIV} assume panmixis within lymphoid tissue. We present a simple "metapopulation" model of {HIV} replication, where the population of infected cells is comprised of a large number of small populations, each of which is established by a few founder viruses and undergoes turnover. To test this model, we analyzed viral genetic variation of infected cell subpopulations within the spleen and demonstrated the action of founder effects as well as significant variation in the extent of genetic differentiation between subpopulations among patients. The combination of founder effects and subpopulation turnover can result in an effective population size much lower than the actual population size and may contribute to the importance of genetic drift in {HIV} evolution despite a large number of infected cells.},

However, while the method is often used to inform about historical demographic processes, little is known about the relationship between fundamental demographic parameters and the projection of samples onto the primary axes. Here I show that for SNP data the projection of samples onto the principal components can be obtained directly from considering the average coalescent times between pairs of haploid genomes. The result provides a framework for interpreting PCA projections in terms of underlying processes, including migration, geographical isolation, and admixture. I also demonstrate a link between PCA and Wright's f(st) and show that SNP ascertainment has a largely simple and predictable effect on the projection of samples. Using examples from human genetics, I discuss the application of these results to empirical data and the implications for inference.},

abstract = {The bacterial flagellar motor is a highly efficient rotary machine used by many bacteria to propel themselves. It has recently been shown that at low speeds its rotation proceeds in steps. Here we propose a simple physical model, based on the storage of energy in protein springs, that accounts for this stepping behavior as a random walk in a tilted corrugated potential that combines torque and contact forces. We argue that the absolute angular position of the rotor is crucial for understanding step properties and show this hypothesis to be consistent with the available data, in particular the observation that backward steps are smaller on average than forward steps. We also predict a sublinear speed versus torque relationship for fixed load at low torque, and a peak in rotor diffusion as a function of torque. Our model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and analyzing stepping behavior in the bacterial flagellar motor and proposes novel, testable predictions. More broadly, the storage of energy in protein springs by the flagellar motor may provide useful general insights into the design of highly efficient molecular machines.},

abstract = {The latency of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV}-1) in resting primary CD4+ T cells is the major barrier for the eradication of the virus in patients on suppressive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Even with optimal HAART treatment, replication-competent HIV-1 still exists in resting primary CD4+ T cells. Multiple restriction factors that act upon various steps of the viral life cycle could contribute to viral latency. Here we show that cellular microRNAs (miRNAs) potently inhibit HIV-1 production in resting primary CD4+ T cells. We have found that the 3' ends of HIV-1 messenger RNAs are targeted by a cluster of cellular miRNAs including miR-28, miR-125b, miR-150, miR-223 and miR-382, which are enriched in resting CD4+ T cells as compared to activated CD4+ T cells. Specific inhibitors of these miRNAs substantially counteracted their effects on the target mRNAs, measured either as HIV-1 protein translation in resting CD4+ T cells transfected with HIV-1 infectious clones, or as HIV-1 virus production from resting CD4+ T cells isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals on suppressive HAART. Our data indicate that cellular miRNAs are pivotal in HIV-1 latency and suggest that manipulation of cellular miRNAs could be a novel approach for purging the HIV-1 reservoir.},

title = {The role of hybridization in evolution},
abstract = {Hybridization may influence evolution in a variety of ways. If hybrids are less fit, the geographical range of ecologically divergent populations may be limited, and prezygotic reproductive isolation may be reinforced. If some hybrid genotypes are fitter than one or both parents, at least in some environments, then hybridization could make a positive contribution. Single alleles that are at an advantage in the alternative environment and genetic background will introgress readily, although such introgression may be hard to detect. 'Hybrid speciation', in which fit combinations of alleles are established, is more problematic; its likelihood depends on how divergent populations meet, and on the structure of epistasis. These issues are illustrated using Fisher's model of stabilizing selection on multiple traits, under which reproductive isolation evolves as a side-effect of adaptation in allopatry. This confirms a priori arguments that while recombinant hybrids are less fit on average, some gene combinations may be fitter than the parents, even in the parental environment. Fisher's model does predict heterosis in diploid F1s, asymmetric incompatibility in reciprocal backcrosses, and (when dominance is included) Haldane's Rule. However, heterosis arises only when traits are additive, whereas the latter two patterns require dominance. Moreover, because adaptation is via substitutions of small effect, Fisher's model does not generate the strong effects of single chromosome regions often observed in species crosses.},

abstract = {The evolution of competitive interactions among viruses was studied in the RNA phage phi6 at high and low multiplicities of infection (that is, at high and low ratios of infecting phage to host cells). At high multiplicities, many phage infect and reproduce in the same host cell, whereas at low multiplicities the viruses reproduce mainly as clones. An unexpected result of this study was that phage grown at high rates of co-infection increased in fitness initially, but then evolved lowered fitness. Here we show that the fitness of the high-multiplicity phage relative to their ancestors generates a pay-off matrix conforming to the prisoner's dilemma strategy of game theory. In this strategy, defection (selfishness) evolves, despite the greater fitness pay-off that would result if all players were to cooperate. Viral cooperation and defection can be defined as, respectively, the manufacturing and sequestering of diffusible (shared) intracellular products. Because the low-multiplicity phage did not evolve lowered fitness, we attribute the evolution of selfishness to the lack of clonal structure and the mixing of unrelated genotypes at high multiplicity.},

title = {Gene co-inheritance and gene transfer},
abstract = {Functional transfer of mitochondrial genes to the nucleus is very common in some taxa but entirely lacking in others. Current evolutionary theories to account for this variation predict that outcrossing, which allows escape from Muller's ratchet and faster spread of beneficial mutations, should favor gene transfer. We find that functional gene transfer is more common in selfing or clonal plants than in outcrossing plants, a pattern opposite to prediction. We suggest that reproductive modes, such as selfing and vegetative reproduction, conserve adaptive mitonuclear gene combinations, allowing functional transfer, whereas outcrossing prevents transfer by breaking up these combinations.},

title = {Genome-scale analysis of positional clustering of mouse testis-specific genes},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genes are not randomly distributed on a chromosome as they were thought even after removal of tandem repeats. The positional clustering of co-expressed genes is known in prokaryotes and recently reported in several eukaryotic organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Homo sapiens. In order to further investigate the mode of tissue-specific gene clustering in higher eukaryotes, we have performed a genome-scale analysis of positional clustering of the mouse testis-specific genes. RESULTS: Our computational analysis shows that a large proportion of testis-specific genes are clustered in groups of 2 to 5 genes in the mouse genome. The number of clusters is much higher than expected by chance even after removal of tandem repeats. CONCLUSION: Our result suggests that testis-specific genes tend to cluster on the mouse chromosomes. This provides another piece of evidence for the hypothesis that clusters of tissue-specific genes do exist.},

abstract = {Coinfection in RNA virus populations results in two important phenomena, complementation and recombination. Of the two, complementation has a strong effect on selection against deleterious mutations, as has been confirmed in earlier studies. As complementation delays the purging of less-fit mutations, coinfection may be detrimental to the evolution of a virus population. Here we employ both deterministic modeling and stochastic simulation to explore the mechanisms underlying the interactions between complementation and other evolutionary factors, namely, mutation, selection, and epistasis. We find that strong complementation reduces slightly the overall fitness of a virus population but substantially enhances its diversity and robustness, especially when interacting with selection and epistasis.},

abstract = {Viral latency is a reversibly non-productive state of infection that allows some viruses to evade host immune responses. As a consequence of its tropism for activated CD4(+) T cells, HIV-1 can establish latent infection in resting memory CD4(+) T cells, which are generated when activated CD4(+) T cells return to a quiescent state. Latent HIV-1 persists as a stably integrated but transcriptionally silent provirus. In this state, the virus is unaffected by immune responses or antiretroviral drugs, and this latent reservoir in resting CD4(+) T cells is a major barrier to curing the infection. Unfortunately, there is no simple assay to measure the number of latently infected cells in a patient, nor is there an entirely representative in vitro model in which to explore the molecular mechanisms of latency. This Review will consider current approaches to the analysis of HIV-1 latency both in vivo and in vitro.},

abstract = {The experimental material accumulated in the literature on the conformational behavior of intrinsically unstructured (natively unfolded) proteins was analyzed. Results of this analysis showed that these proteins do not possess uniform structural properties, as expected for members of a single thermodynamic entity. Rather, these proteins may be divided into two structurally different groups: intrinsic coils, and premolten globules. Proteins from the first group have hydrodynamic dimensions typical of random coils in poor solvent and do not possess any (or almost any) ordered secondary structure. Proteins from the second group are essentially more compact, exhibiting some amount of residual secondary structure, although they are still less dense than native or molten globule proteins. An important feature of the intrinsically unstructured proteins is that they undergo disorder-order transition during or prior to their biological function. In this respect, the Protein Quartet model, with function arising from four specific conformations (ordered forms, molten globules, premolten globules, and random coils) and transitions between any two of the states, is discussed.},

title = {The effects of local selection, balanced polymorphism and background selection on equilibrium patterns of genetic diversity in subdivided populations},
abstract = {Levels of neutral genetic diversity in populations subdivided into two demes were studied by multilocus stochastic simulations. The model includes deleterious mutations at loci throughout the genome, causing 'background selection', as well as a single locus at which a polymorphism is maintained, either by frequency-dependent selection or by local selective differences. These balanced polymorphisms induce long coalescence times at linked neutral loci, so that sequence diversity at these loci is enhanced at statistical equilibrium. We study how equilibrium neutral diversity levels are affected by the degree of population subdivision, the presence or absence of background selection, and the level of inbreeding of the population. The simulation results are compared with approximate analytical formulae, assuming the infinite sites neutral model. We discuss how balancing selection can be distinguished from local selection, by determining whether peaks of diversity in the region of the polymorphic locus are seen within or between demes. The width of such diversity peaks is shown to depend on the total species population size, rather than local deme sizes. We show that, with population subdivision, local selection enhances between-deme diversity even at neutral sites distant from the polymorphic locus, producing higher FST values than with no selection; very high values can be generated at sites close to a selected locus. Background selection also increases FST, mainly because of decreased diversity within populations, which implies that its effects may be distinguishable from those of local selection. Both effects are stronger in selfing than outcrossing populations. Linkage disequilibrium between neutral sites is generated by both balancing and local selection, especially in selfing populations, because of linkage disequilibrium between the neutral sites and the selectively maintained alleles. We discuss how these theoretical results can be related to data on genetic diversity within and between local populations of a species.},

title = {Quantitative Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Measurements Using Fluorescence Microscopy},
abstract = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a technique used for quantifying the distance between two molecules conjugated to different fluorophores. By combining optical microscopy with FRET it is possible to obtain quantitative temporal and spatial information about the binding and interaction of proteins, lipids, enzymes, DNA, and RNA in vivo. In conjunction with the recent development of a variety of mutant green fluorescent proteins (mtGFPs), FRET microscopy provides the potential to measure the interaction of intracellular molecular species in intact living cells where the donor and acceptor fluorophores are actually part of the molecules themselves. However, steady-state FRET microscopy measurements can suffer from several sources of distortion, which need to be corrected. These include direct excitation of the acceptor at the donor excitation wavelengths and the dependence of FRET on the concentration of acceptor. We present a simple method for the analysis of FRET data obtained with standard filter sets in a fluorescence microscope. This method is corrected for cross talk (any detection of donor fluorescence with the acceptor emission filter and any detection of acceptor fluorescence with the donor emission filter), and for the dependence of FRET on the concentrations of the donor and acceptor. Measurements of the interaction of the proteins Bcl-2 and Beclin (a recently identified Bcl-2 interacting protein located on chromosome 17q21), are shown to document the accuracy of this approach for correction of donor and acceptor concentrations, and cross talk between the different filter units.},

However, a recent increase in DNA sequence data and the development of new methods of analysis have finally made this question tractable. Here, I review the current state-of-play of the field. Initial estimates in Drosophila suggest that approximately 50% of all amino acid substitutions, and a substantial fraction of substitutions in non-coding DNA, have been fixed as a consequence of adaptive evolution. Estimates in microorganisms are even higher. By contrast, there is little evidence of widespread adaptive evolution in our own species.},

title = {Genomewide spatial correspondence between nonsynonymous divergence and neutral polymorphism reveals extensive adaptation in {Drosophila}},
abstract = {The effect of recurrent selective sweeps is a spatially heterogeneous reduction in neutral polymorphism throughout the genome. The pattern of reduction depends on the selective advantage and recurrence rate of the sweeps. Because many adaptive substitutions responsible for these sweeps also contribute to nonsynonymous divergence, the spatial distribution of nonsynonymous divergence also reflects the distribution of adaptive substitutions. Thus, the spatial correspondence between neutral polymorphism and nonsynonymous divergence may be especially informative about the process of adaptation. Here we study this correspondence using genomewide polymorphism data from Drosophila simulans and the divergence between D. simulans and D. melanogaster. Focusing on highly recombining portions of the autosomes, at a spatial scale appropriate to the study of selective sweeps, we find that neutral polymorphism is both lower and, as measured by a new statistic Q(S), less homogeneous where nonsynonymous divergence is higher and that the spatial structure of this correlation is best explained by the action of strong recurrent selective sweeps. We introduce a method to infer, from the spatial correspondence between polymorphism and divergence, the rate and selective strength of adaptation. Our results independently confirm a high rate of adaptive substitution (approximately 1/3000 generations) and newly suggest that many adaptations are of surprisingly great selective effect (approximately 1%), reducing the effective population size by approximately 15% even in highly recombining regions of the genome.},

In the genome the number of repeat units of repetitive sequences, known as microsatellites, may vary during replication by DNA slippage and their expansion gives rise to serious disorders. We studied the mechanical properties of repetitive DNA using dynamic force spectroscopy and found striking differences compared with ordinary heterogeneous sequences. Repetitive sequences dissociate at lower forces and elongate above a certain threshold force. This yield force was found to be rate dependent. Following the rapid stretching of the DNA duplex, the applied force relaxes by stepwise elongation of this duplex. Conversely, contraction of the DNA duplex can be observed at low forces. The stepwise elongation and shortening is initiated by single slippage events, and single-molecule experiments might help to explain the molecular mechanisms of microsatellites formation. In addition to the biological importance, the remarkable properties of repetitive DNA can be useful for different nanomechanical applications.},

title = {Chromosomal clustering of muscle-expressed genes in Caenorhabditis elegans},
abstract = {Chromosomes are divided into domains of open chromatin, where genes have the potential to be expressed, and domains of closed chromatin, where genes are not expressed. Classic examples of open chromatin domains include 'puffs' on polytene chromosomes in Drosophila and extended loops from lampbrush chromosomes. If multiple genes were typically expressed together from a single open chromatin domain, the position of co-expressed genes along the chromosomes would appear clustered. To investigate whether co-expressed genes are clustered, we examined the chromosomal positions of the genes expressed in the muscle of Caenorhabditis elegans at the first larval stage. Here we show that co-expressed genes in C. elegans are clustered in groups of 2-5 along the chromosomes, suggesting that expression from a chromatin domain can extend over several genes. These observations reveal a higher-order organization of the structure of the genome, in which the order of the genes along the chromosome id correlated with their expression in specific tissues.},

title = {The evolution of recombination in a heterogeneous environment},
abstract = {Most models describing the evolution of recombination have focused on the case of a single population, implicitly assuming that all individuals are equally likely to mate and that spatial heterogeneity in selection is absent. In these models, the evolution of recombination is driven by linkage disequilibria generated either by epistatic selection or drift. Models based on epistatic selection show that recombination can be favored if epistasis is negative and weak compared to directional selection and if the recombination modifier locus is tightly linked to the selected loci. In this article, we examine the joint effects of spatial heterogeneity in selection and epistasis on the evolution of recombination. In a model with two patches, each subject to different selection regimes, we consider the cases of mutation-selection and migration-selection balance as well as the spread of beneficial alleles. We find that including spatial heterogeneity extends the range of epistasis over which recombination can be favored. Indeed, recombination can be favored without epistasis, with negative and even with positive epistasis depending on environmental circumstances. The selection pressure acting on recombination-modifier loci is often much stronger with spatial heterogeneity, and even loosely linked modifiers and free linkage may evolve. In each case, predicting whether recombination is favored requires knowledge of both the type of environmental heterogeneity and epistasis, as none of these factors alone is sufficient to predict the outcome.},

title = {The evolution of sex and recombination in a varying environment},
abstract = {Theoretical models of the evolutionary advantages of sex and genetic recombination in a temporally varying environment are analyzed. The models assume a quantitative trait controlled by many additive genes and subject to nor-optimal selection. The optimal value of the trait is assumed either to move steadily in one direction or to follow an autocorrelated linear Markov process. The consequences for population mean fitness of a reduction in genetic variance, due to a shift from sexual to asexual reproduction, are examined. It is shown that a large reduction in mean fitness can result from such a shift in the case of a steadily moving optimum, under light conditions. The conditions are much more stringent with a randomly varying environment, especially if the autocorrelation is low. The conditions for spread of a rare modifier affecting the rate of genetic recombination are also examined, and the strength of selection on such a modifier is determined. Again, the case of a steadily moving optimum is more favorable than a random optimum for the evolution of increased recombination.},

title = {Path-memory induced quantization of classical orbits},
abstract = {A droplet bouncing on a liquid bath can self-propel due to its interaction with the waves it generates. The resulting "walker" is a dynamical association where, at a macroscopic scale, a particle (the droplet) is driven by a pilot-wave field. A specificity of this system is that the wave field itself results from the superposition of the waves generated at the points of space recently visited by the particle. It thus contains a memory of the past trajectory of the particle. Here, we investigate the response of this object to forces orthogonal to its motion. We find that the resulting closed orbits present a spontaneous quantization. This is observed only when the memory of the system is long enough for the particle to interact with the wave sources distributed along the whole orbit. An additional force then limits the possible orbits to a discrete set. The wave-sustained path memory is thus demonstrated to generate a quantization of angular momentum. Because a quantum-like uncertainty was also observed recently in these systems, the nonlocality generated by path memory opens new perspectives.},

In these studies the host population is assumed to be genetically homogeneous. However, many parasites have a broad range of host types they infect, and trade-offs between the parasite virulence in different host types may exist. The aim of this paper is to study the effect of host heterogeneity on the evolution of parasite virulence. By analyzing a simple model that describes the replication of different parasite strains in a population of two different host types, we determine the optimal level of virulence in both host types and find the conditions under which strains that specialize in one host type dominate the parasite population. Furthermore, we show that intrahost evolution of the parasite during an infection may lead to stable polymorphisms and could introduce evolutionary branching in the parasite population.},

title = {Extended spectrum of {HIV}-1 reverse transcriptase mutations in patients receiving multiple nucleoside analog inhibitors},
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To characterize reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations by their association with extent of nucleoside RT inhibitor (NRTI) therapy. To identify mutational clusters in RT sequences from persons receiving multiple NRTI. DESIGN: A total of 1210 RT sequences from persons with known antiretroviral therapy were analyzed: 641 new sequences were performed at Stanford University Hospital; 569 were previously published. METHODS: Chi-square tests and logistic regression were done to identify associations between mutations and NRTI therapy. Correlation studies were done to identify mutational clusters. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to correct for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Mutations at 26 positions were significantly associated with NRTI including 17 known resistance mutations (positions 41, 44, 62, 65, 67, 69, 70, 74, 75, 77, 116, 118, 151, 184, 210, 215, 219) and nine previously unreported mutations (positions 20, 39, 43, 203, 208, 218, 221, 223, 228). The nine new mutations correlated linearly with number of NRTI; 777 out of 817 (95%) instances occurred with known drug resistance mutations. Positions 203, 208, 218, 221, 223, and 228 were conserved in untreated persons; positions 20, 39, and 43 were polymorphic. Most NRTI-associated mutations clustered into three groups: (i) 62, 65, 75, 77, 115, 116, 151; (ii) 41, 43, 44, 118, 208, 210, 215, 223; (iii) 67, 69, 70, 218, 219, 228. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations at nine previously unreported positions are associated with NRTI therapy. These mutations are probably accessory because they occur almost exclusively with known drug resistance mutations. Most NRTI mutations group into one of three clusters, although several (e.g., M184V) occur in multiple mutational contexts.},

abstract = {Identifying the forces responsible for the origin and maintenance of sexuality remains one of the greatest unsolved problems in biology. The mutational deterministic hypothesis postulates that sex is an adaptation that allows deleterious mutations to be purged from the genome; it requires synergistic interactions, which means that two mutations would be more harmful together than expected from their separate effects. We generated 225 genotypes of Escherichia coli carrying one, two or three successive mutations and measured their fitness relative to an unmutated competitor. The relationship between mutation number and average fitness is nearly log-linear. We also constructed 27 recombinant genotypes having pairs of mutations whose separate and combined effects on fitness were determined. Several pairs exhibit significant interactions for fitness, but they are antagonistic as often as they are synergistic. These results do not support the mutational deterministic hypothesis for the evolution of sex.},

abstract = {Deleterious mutations are considered a major impediment to adaptation, and there are straightforward expectations for the rate at which they accumulate as a function of population size and mutation rate. In a simulation model of an evolving population of asexually replicating RNA molecules, initially deleterious mutations accumulated at rates nearly equal to that of initially beneficial mutations, without impeding evolutionary progress. As the mutation rate was increased within a moderate range, deleterious mutation accumulation and mean fitness improvement both increased. The fixation rates were higher than predicted by many population-genetic models. This seemingly paradoxical result was resolved in part by the observation that, during the time to fixation, the selection coefficient (s) of initially deleterious mutations reversed to confer a selective advantage. Significantly, more than half of the fixations of initially deleterious mutations involved fitness reversals. These fitness reversals had a substantial effect on the total fitness of the genome and thus contributed to its success in the population. Despite the relative importance of fitness reversals, however, the probabilities of fixation for both initially beneficial and initially deleterious mutations were exceedingly small (on the order of 10(-5) of all mutations).},

title = {Genome-wide strategies for detecting multiple loci that influence complex diseases},
abstract = {After nearly 10 years of intense academic and commercial research effort, large genome-wide association studies for common complex diseases are now imminent. Although these conditions involve a complex relationship between genotype and phenotype, including interactions between unlinked loci, the prevailing strategies for analysis of such studies focus on the locus-by-locus paradigm. Here we consider analytical methods that explicitly look for statistical interactions between loci. We show first that they are computationally feasible, even for studies of hundreds of thousands of loci, and second that even with a conservative correction for multiple testing, they can be more powerful than traditional analyses under a range of models for interlocus interactions. We also show that plausible variations across populations in allele frequencies among interacting loci can markedly affect the power to detect their marginal effects, which may account in part for the well-known difficulties in replicating association results. These results suggest that searching for interactions among genetic loci can be fruitfully incorporated into analysis strategies for genome-wide association studies.},

title = {Examining emergence of functional gene clustering in a simulated evolution},
abstract = {Recent research suggests that rather than being random, gene order may be coupled with gene functionality. These findings may be explained by mechanisms that require physical proximity such as co-expression and co-regulation. Alternatively, they may be due to evolutionary-dynamics forces, as expressed in genetic drift or linkage disequilibrium. This paper proposes a biologically plausible model for evolutionary development. Using the model, which includes natural selection and the development of gene networks and cellular organisms, the co-evolution of recombination rate and gene functionality is examined. The results presented here are compatible with previous biological findings showing that functionally related genes are clustered. These results imply that evolutionary pressure in a complex environment is sufficient for the emergence of gene order that is coupled with functionality. They shed further light on the mechanisms that may cause such gene clusters.},

title = {The evolution of postzygotic isolation: accumulating Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities},
abstract = {Hybrid sterility and inviability often result from the accumulation of substitutions that, while functional on their normal genetic backgrounds, cause a loss of fitness when brought together in hybrids. Previous theory has shown that such Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities should accumulate at least as fast as the square of the number of substitutions separating two species, the so-called snowball effect. Here we explicitly describe the stochastic accumulation of these incompatibilities as a function of time. The accumulation of these incompatibilities involves three levels of stochasticity: (1) the number of substitutions separating two allopatric lineages at a given time; (2) the number of incompatibilities resulting from these substitutions; and (3) the fitness effects of individual incompatibilities. Previous analyses ignored the stochasticity of molecular evolution (level 1) as well as that due to the variable effects of incompatibilities (level 3). Here we approximate the full stochastic process characterizing the accumulation of hybrid incompatibilities between pairs of loci. We derive the distribution of the number of incompatibilities as a function of divergence time between allopatric taxa as well as the distribution of waiting times to speciation by postzygotic isolation. We provide simple approximations for the mean and variance of these waiting times. These results let us estimate. albeit crudely, the probability, p, that two diverged sites from different species will contribute to hybrid sterility or inviability. Our analyses of data from Drosophila and Bombina suggest that p is generally very small, on the order of 10(-6) or less.},

title = {The genetic architecture of shoot branching in Arabidopsis thaliana: a comparative assessment of candidate gene associations vs. quantitative trait locus mapping},
abstract = {Association mapping focused on 36 genes involved in branch development was used to identify candidate genes for variation in shoot branching in Arabidopsis thaliana. The associations between four branching traits and moderate-frequency haplogroups at the studied genes were tested in a panel of 96 accessions from a restricted geographic range in Central Europe. Using a mixed-model association-mapping method, we identified three loci--MORE AXILLARY GROWTH 2 (MAX2), MORE AXILLARY GROWTH 3 (MAX3), and SUPERSHOOT 1 (SPS1)--that were significantly associated with branching variation. On the basis of a more extensive examination of the MAX2 and MAX3 genomic regions, we find that linkage disequilibrium in these regions decays within approximately 10 kb and trait associations localize to the candidate genes in these regions. When the significant associations are compared to relevant quantitative trait loci (QTL) from previous Ler x Col and Cvi x Ler recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping studies, no additive QTL overlapping these candidate genes are observed, although epistatic QTL for branching, including one that spans the SPS1, are found. These results suggest that epistasis is prevalent in determining branching variation in A. thaliana and may need to be considered in linkage disequilibrium mapping studies of genetically diverse accessions.},

We find that the dynamics of the population is governed by correlation functions that although being formally down by powers of N (the population size), nonetheless control the evolution process after a very short transient. The long-time behavior can be found analytically since only one of these higher order correlators (the two-paint function) is relevant. We compare and contrast the exact findings derived herein with a previously proposed phenomenological treatment employing mean-field theory supplemented with a cutoff at small population density. Finally, we relate our results to the recently studied case of mutation on a totally flat landscape.},

title = {Stochastic interplay between mutation and recombination during the acquisition of drug resistance mutations in human immunodeficiency virus type 1},
abstract = {The emergence of drug resistance mutations in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been a major setback in the treatment of infected patients. Besides the high mutation rate, recombination has been conjectured to have an important impact on the emergence of drug resistance. Population genetic theory suggests that in populations limited in size recombination may facilitate the acquisition of beneficial mutations. The viral population in an infected patient may indeed represent such a population limited in size, since current estimates of the effective population size range from 500 to 10(5). To address the effects of limited population size, we therefore expand a previously described deterministic population genetic model of HIV replication by incorporating the stochastic processes that occur in finite populations of infected cells. Using parameter estimates from the literature, we simulate the evolution of drug-resistant viral strains. The simulations show that recombination has only a minor effect on the rate of acquisition of drug resistance mutations in populations with effective population sizes as small as 1,000, since in these populations, viral strains typically fix beneficial mutations sequentially. However, for intermediate effective population sizes (10(4) to 10(5)), recombination can accelerate the evolution of drug resistance by up to 25%. Furthermore, a reduction in population size caused by drug therapy can be overcome by a higher viral mutation rate, leading to a faster evolution of drug resistance.},

Here we determined to what degree recombination rates are conserved among closely related species by estimating recombination rates from 14 Mb of linkage disequilibrium data in central chimpanzee and human populations. The results suggest that recombination hotspots are not conserved between the two species and that recombination rates in larger (50 kb) genomic regions are only weakly conserved.

We have determined the crystallographic structure of a complex formed between the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of a neutralizing antibody and the membrane-distal domain ('HA top') of a HA subunit prepared from HA in its membrane-fusion-active conformation. A dramatic change is seen in the structure of the Fab-combining site on complex formation. Our results indicate that neutralization of infectivity by this antibody involves the inhibition of receptor binding, and demonstrate how influenza virus can maintain its conserved receptor-binding site despite the immune selective pressure for change in this region of the molecule; they also contribute to a complete description of the endosomal pH-induced fusion-active HA structure.},

title = {Dynamics of {HIV}-1 recombination in its natural target cells},
abstract = {Genetic recombination is believed to assist HIV-1 diversification and escape from host immunity and antiviral therapies, yet this process remains largely unexamined within the natural target-cell populations. We developed a method for measuring HIV-1 recombination directly that employs reporter viruses bearing functional enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) genes in which recombination produces a modified GFP gene and GFP fluorescence in the infected cells. These reporter viruses allow simultaneous quantification of the dynamics of HIV-1 infection, coinfection, and recombination in cell culture and in animal models by flow-cytometric analysis. Multiround infection assays revealed that productive cellular coinfection was subject to little functional inhibition. As a result, generation of recombinants proceeded according to the square of the infection rate during HIV-1 replication in T lymphocytes and within human thymic grafts in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)-hu (Thy/Liv) mice. These results suggest that increases in viral load may confer a compounding risk of virus escape by means of recombinational diversification. A single round of replication in T lymphocytes in culture generated an average of nine recombination events per virus, and infection of macrophages led to approximately 30 crossover events, making HIV-1 up to an order of magnitude more recombinogenic than recognized previously and demonstrating that the infected cell exerts a profound influence on the frequency of recombination.},

title = {Recco: recombination analysis using cost optimization},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Recombination plays an important role in the evolution of many pathogens, such as HIV or malaria. Despite substantial prior work, there is still a pressing need for efficient and effective methods of detecting recombination and analyzing recombinant sequences. RESULTS: We introduce Recco, a novel fast method that, given a multiple sequence alignment, scores the cost of obtaining one of the sequences from the others by mutation and recombination. The algorithm comes with an illustrative visualization tool for locating recombination breakpoints. We analyze the sequence alignment with respect to all choices of the parameter alpha weighting recombination cost against mutation cost. The analysis of the resulting cost curve yields additional information as to which sequence might be recombinant. On random genealogies Recco is comparable in its power of detecting recombination with the algorithm Geneconv (Sawyer, 1989). For specific relevant recombination scenarios Recco significantly outperforms Geneconv.},

This article generalizes their approach to allow for arbitrary modes of inheritance, including diploidy, polyploidy, sex linkage, cytoplasmic inheritance, and genomic imprinting. The framework is also extended to allow for other deterministic evolutionary forces, including migration and mutation. Exact recursions that fully describe the state of the population are presented; these are implemented in a computer algebra package (available on the Web at http://helios.bto.ed.ac.uk/evolgen). Despite the generality of our framework, it can describe evolutionary dynamics exactly by just two equations. These recursions can be further simplified using a "quasi-linkage equilibrium" (QLE) approximation. We illustrate the methods by finding the effect of natural selection, sexual selection, mutation, and migration on the genetic composition of a population.},

abstract = {Mutation is the ultimate source of biological diversity because it generates the variation that fuels evolution. Gene expression is the first step by which an organism translates genetic information into developmental change. Here we estimate the rate at which mutation produces new variation in gene expression by measuring transcript abundances across the genome during the onset of metamorphosis in 12 initially identical Drosophila melanogaster lines that independently accumulated mutations for 200 generations. We find statistically significant mutational variation for 39% of the genome and a wide range of variability across corresponding genes. As genes are upregulated in development their variability decreases, and as they are downregulated it increases, indicating that developmental context affects the evolution of gene expression. A strong correlation between mutational variance and environmental variance shows that there is the potential for widespread canalization. By comparing the evolutionary rates that we report here with differences between species, we conclude that gene expression does not evolve according to strictly neutral models. Although spontaneous mutations have the potential to generate abundant variation in gene expression, natural variation is relatively constrained.},

title = {Sperm cross-over activity in regions of the human genome showing extreme breakdown of marker association},
abstract = {Population diversity data have recently provided profound, albeit inferential, insights into meiotic recombination across the human genome, revealing a landscape dominated by thousands of cross-over hotspots. However, very few of these putative hotspots have been directly analyzed for cross-over activity. We now describe a search for very active hotspots, by using extreme breakdown of marker association as a guide for high-resolution sperm cross-over analysis. This strategy has led to the isolation of the most active cross-over hotspots yet described. Their morphology, sequence attributes, and cross-over processes are very similar to those seen at less active hotspots, but their activity in sperm is poorly predicted from population diversity information. Several of these hotspots showed evidence for biased gene conversion accompanying cross-over, in some cases associated with variation between men in cross-over activity and with two hotspots showing complete presence/absence polymorphism in different men. Hotspot polymorphism is very common at less active hotspots but curiously was not seen at any of the most active hotspots. This contrasts with the prediction that extreme hotspots should be the most vulnerable to attenuation by meiotic drive in favor of mutations that suppress recombination and should therefore show rapid rate evolution and thus variation in activity between men. Finally, these very intense hotspots provide a valuable resource for dissecting meiotic recombination processes and pathways in humans.},

Pelvic loss in different natural populations of threespine stickleback fish has occurred through regulatory mutations deleting a tissue-specific enhancer of the Pituitary homeobox transcription factor 1 (Pitx1) gene. The high prevalence of deletion mutations at Pitx1 may be influenced by inherent structural features of the locus. Although Pitx1 null mutations are lethal in laboratory animals, Pitx1 regulatory mutations show molecular signatures of positive selection in pelvic-reduced populations. These studies illustrate how major expression and morphological changes can arise from single mutational leaps in natural populations, producing new adaptive alleles via recurrent regulatory alterations in a key developmental control gene.},

title = {Simultaneous confocal recording of multiple fluorescent labels with improved channel separation},
abstract = {Confocal microscopes are often used to study specimens labelled with fluorophores. A commonly used method for simultaneous recording of the distribution of multiple fluorophores is to divide the fluorescent light emitted by the specimen into different wavelength regions using dichroic and bandpass filters. These different wavelength regions are then distributed to multiple detectors. However, the broad and overlapping spectra of commonly used fluorophores often result in considerable crosstalk between channels. A new technique, intensity-modulated multiple-beam scanning (IMS) microfluorometry, can be used to reduce this cross-talk substantially. The IMS technique is implemented with two laser beams of different wavelengths, intensity-modulated at different frequencies, which illuminate the specimen simultaneously. The two laser wavelengths predominantly excite one fluorophore each. Fluorescent light from the specimen is divided into two wavelength regions (red and green) which are detected by two photomultiplier tubes. The output signals from the photomultiplier tubes are connected to lock-in amplifiers. The effect of using modulated laser beams, in combination with lock-in amplifiers, is strongly to reduce cross-talk between the channels. The performance of the IMS technique using various types of specimen is compared with the results obtained using the conventional multi-detector method.},

title = {Core signaling pathways in human pancreatic cancers revealed by global genomic analyses},
abstract = {There are currently few therapeutic options for patients with pancreatic cancer, and new insights into the pathogenesis of this lethal disease are urgently needed. Toward this end, we performed a comprehensive genetic analysis of 24 pancreatic cancers. We first determined the sequences of 23,219 transcripts, representing 20,661 protein-coding genes, in these samples. Then, we searched for homozygous deletions and amplifications in the tumor DNA by using microarrays containing probes for approximately 10(6) single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We found that pancreatic cancers contain an average of 63 genetic alterations, the majority of which are point mutations. These alterations defined a core set of 12 cellular signaling pathways and processes that were each genetically altered in 67 to 100% of the tumors. Analysis of these tumors' transcriptomes with next-generation sequencing-by-synthesis technologies provided independent evidence for the importance of these pathways and processes. Our data indicate that genetically altered core pathways and regulatory processes only become evident once the coding regions of the genome are analyzed in depth. Dysregulation of these core pathways and processes through mutation can explain the major features of pancreatic tumorigenesis.},

abstract = { Central to the functioning of a living cell is its ability to control the readout or expression of information encoded in the genome. In many cases, a single transcription factor protein activates or represses the expression of many genes. As the concentration of the transcription factor varies, the target genes thus undergo correlated changes, and this redundancy limits the ability of the cell to transmit information about input signals. We explore how interactions among the target genes can reduce this redundancy and optimize information transmission. Our discussion builds on recent work [Tkacik et al, Phys Rev E 80, 031920 (2009)], and there are connections to much earlier work on the role of lateral inhibition in enhancing the efficiency of information transmission in neural circuits; for simplicity we consider here the case where the interactions have a feed forward structure, with no loops. Even with this limitation, the networks that optimize information transmission have a structure reminiscent of the networks found in real biological systems. },

title = {Soft sweeps: molecular population genetics of adaptation from standing genetic variation},
abstract = {A population can adapt to a rapid environmental change or habitat expansion in two ways. It may adapt either through new beneficial mutations that subsequently sweep through the population or by using alleles from the standing genetic variation. We use diffusion theory to calculate the probabilities for selective adaptations and find a large increase in the fixation probability for weak substitutions, if alleles originate from the standing genetic variation. We then determine the parameter regions where each scenario-standing variation vs. new mutations-is more likely. Adaptations from the standing genetic variation are favored if either the selective advantage is weak or the selection coefficient and the mutation rate are both high. Finally, we analyze the probability of "soft sweeps," where multiple copies of the selected allele contribute to a substitution, and discuss the consequences for the footprint of selection on linked neutral variation. We find that soft sweeps with weaker selective footprints are likely under both scenarios if the mutation rate and/or the selection coefficient is high.},

abstract = { We study the dynamics of a knot in a semiflexible polymer confined to a narrow channel of width comparable to the polymers' persistence length. Using a combination of Brownian dynamics simulations and a coarse-grained stochastic model, we characterize the coupled dynamics of knot size variation and knot diffusion along the polymer, which ultimately leads to spontaneous unknotting. We find that the knot grows to macroscopic size before disappearing. Interestingly, an external force applied to the ends of the confined polymer speeds up spontaneous unknotting. },

title = {Interference among deleterious mutations favours sex and recombination in finite populations},
abstract = {Sex and recombination are widespread, but explaining these phenomena has been one of the most difficult problems in evolutionary biology. Recombination is advantageous when different individuals in a population carry different advantageous alleles. By bringing together advantageous alleles onto the same chromosome, recombination speeds up the process of adaptation and opposes the fixation of harmful mutations by means of Muller's ratchet. Nevertheless, adaptive substitutions favour sex and recombination only if the rate of adaptive mutation is high, and Muller's ratchet operates only in small or asexual populations. Here, by tracking the fate of modifier alleles that alter the frequency of sex and recombination, we show that background selection against deleterious mutant alleles provides a stochastic advantage to sex and recombination that increases with population size. The advantage arises because, with low levels of recombination, selection at other loci severely reduces the effective population size and genetic variance in fitness at a focal locus (the Hill-Robertson effect), making a population less able to respond to selection and to rid itself of deleterious mutations. Sex and recombination reveal the hidden genetic variance in fitness by combining chromosomes of intermediate fitness to create chromosomes that are relatively free of (or are loaded with) deleterious mutations. This increase in genetic variance within finite populations improves the response to selection and generates a substantial advantage to sex and recombination that is fairly insensitive to the form of epistatic interactions between deleterious alleles. The mechanism supported by our results offers a robust and broadly applicable explanation for the evolutionary advantage of recombination and can explain the spread of costly sex.},

abstract = {REVIEW Most higher organisms reproduce sexually, despite the automatic reproductive advantage experienced by asexual variants. This implies the operation of selective forces that confer an advantage to sexuality and genetic recombination, at either the population or individual level. The effect of sex and recombination in breaking down negative correlations between favorable variants at different genetic loci, which increases the efficiency of natural selection, is likely to be a major factor favoring their evolution and maintenance. Various processes that can cause such an effect have been studied theoretically. It has, however, so far proved hard to discriminate among them empirically.},

title = {Control of meiotic recombination and gene expression in yeast by a simple repetitive DNA sequence that excludes nucleosomes},
abstract = {Tandem repeats of the pentanucleotide 5'-CCGNN (where N indicates any base) were previously shown to exclude nucleosomes in vitro (Y. -H. Wang and J. D. Griffith, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:8863-8867, 1996). To determine the in vivo effects of these sequences, we replaced the upstream regulatory sequences of the HIS4 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with either 12 or 48 tandem copies of CCGNN. Both tracts activated HIS4 transcription. We found that (CCGNN)(12) tracts elevated meiotic recombination (hot spot activity), whereas the (CCGNN)(48) tract repressed recombination (cold spot activity). In addition, a "pure" tract of (CCGAT)(12) activated both transcription and meiotic recombination. We suggest that the cold spot activity of the (CCGNN)(48) tract is related to the phenomenon of the suppressive interactions of adjacent hot spots previously described in yeast (Q.-Q. Fan, F. Xu, and T. D. Petes, Mol. Cell. Biol. 15:1679-1688, 1995; Q.-Q. Fan, F. Xu, M. A. White, and T. D. Petes, Genetics 145:661-670, 1997; T.-C. Wu and M. Lichten, Genetics 140:55-66, 1995; L. Xu and N.

abstract = {Cells use protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions to regulate transcription. A biophysical understanding of this process has, however, been limited by the lack of methods for quantitatively characterizing the interactions that occur at specific promoters and enhancers in living cells. Here we show how such biophysical information can be revealed by a simple experiment in which a library of partially mutated regulatory sequences are partitioned according to their in vivo transcriptional activities and then sequenced en masse. Computational analysis of the sequence data produced by this experiment can provide precise quantitative information about how the regulatory proteins at a specific arrangement of binding sites work together to regulate transcription. This ability to reliably extract precise information about regulatory biophysics in the face of experimental noise is made possible by a recently identified relationship between likelihood and mutual information. Applying our experimental and computational techniques to the Escherichia coli lac promoter, we demonstrate the ability to identify regulatory protein binding sites de novo, determine the sequence-dependent binding energy of the proteins that bind these sites, and, importantly, measure the in vivo interaction energy between RNA polymerase and a DNA-bound transcription factor. Our approach provides a generally applicable method for characterizing the biophysical basis of transcriptional regulation by a specified regulatory sequence. The principles of our method can also be applied to a wide range of other problems in molecular biology.},

abstract = {A new mathematical model was used to analyze a detailed set of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) viral load data collected from five infected individuals after the administration of a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 protease. Productively infected cells were estimated to have, on average, a life-span of 2.2 days (half-life t 1/2 = 1.6 days), and plasma virions were estimated to have a mean life-span of 0.3 days (t 1/2 = 0.24 days). The estimated average total HIV-1 production was 10.3 x 10(9) virions per day, which is substantially greater than previous minimum estimates. The results also suggest that the minimum duration of the HIV-1 life cycle in vivo is 1.2 days on average, and that the average HIV-1 generation time--defined as the time from release of a virion until it infects another cell and causes the release of a new generation of viral particles--is 2.6 days. These findings on viral dynamics provide not only a kinetic picture of HIV-1 pathogenesis, but also theoretical principles to guide the development of treatment strategies.},

abstract = {We know very little about the genetic basis of adaptation. Indeed, we can make no theoretical predictions, however heuristic, about the distribution of phenotypic effects among factors fixed during adaptation nor about the expected 'size' of the largest factor fixed. Study of this problem requires taking into account that populations gradually approach a phenotypic optimum during adaptation via the stepwise substitution of favorable mutations. Using Fisher's geometric model of adaptation, I analyze this approach to the optimum, and derive an approximate solution to the size distribution of factors fixed during adaptation. I further generalize these results to allow the input of any distribution of mutational effects. The distribution of factors fixed during adaptation assumes a pleasingly simple, exponential form. This result is remarkably insensitive to changes in the fitness function and in the distribution of mutational effects. An exponential trend among factors fixed appears to be a general property of adaptation toward a fixed optimum.},

title = {Heterogeneous dysregulation of microRNAs across the autism spectrum},
abstract = {microRNAs (miRNAs) are ~21 nt transcripts capable of regulating the expression of many mRNAs and are abundant in the brain. miRNAs have a role in several complex diseases including cancer as well as some neurological diseases such as Tourette's syndrome and Fragile x syndrome. As a genetically complex disease, dysregulation of miRNA expression might be a feature of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Using multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we compared the expression of 466 human miRNAs from postmortem cerebellar cortex tissue of individuals with ASD (n = 13) and a control set of non-autistic cerebellar samples (n = 13). While most miRNAs levels showed little variation across all samples suggesting that autism does not induce global dysfunction of miRNA expression, some miRNAs among the autistic samples were expressed at significantly different levels compared to the mean control value. Twenty-eight miRNAs were expressed at significantly different levels compared to the non-autism control set in at least one of the autism samples. To validate the finding, we reversed the analysis and compared each non-autism control to a single mean value for each miRNA across all autism cases. In this analysis, the number of dysregulated miRNAs fell from 28 to 9 miRNAs. Among the predicted targets of dysregulated miRNAs are genes that are known genetic causes of autism such Neurexin and SHANK3. This study finds that altered miRNA expression levels are observed in postmortem cerebellar cortex from autism patients, a finding which suggests that dysregulation of miRNAs may contribute to autism spectrum phenotype.},

abstract = {The neutral theory of molecular evolution predicts that regions of the genome that evolve at high rates, as revealed by interspecific DNA sequence comparisons, will also exhibit high levels of polymorphism within species. We present here a conservative statistical test of this prediction based on a constant-rate neutral model. The test requires data from an interspecific comparison of at least two regions of the genome and data on levels of intraspecific polymorphism in the same regions from at least one species. The model is rejected for data from the region encompassing the Adh locus and the 5' flanking sequence of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila sechellia. The data depart from the model in a direction that is consistent with the presence of balanced polymorphism in the coding region.},

As a case study, we consider the accumulation of mutations in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase that are associated with drug resistance. The fitted model is statistically validated as a density estimator, and the stability of the model topology is analyzed.

title = {Will population bottlenecks and multilocus epistasis increase additive genetic variance?},
abstract = {We apply new analytical methods to understand the consequences of population bottlenecks for expected additive genetic variance. We analyze essentially all models for multilocus epistasis that have been numerically simulated to demonstrate increased additive variance. We conclude that for biologically plausible models, large increases in expected additive variance--attributable to epistasis rather than dominance--are unlikely. Naciri-Graven and Goudet (2003) found that as the number of epistatically interacting loci increases, additive variance tends to be inflated more after a bottleneck. We argue that this result reflects biologically unrealistic aspects of their models. Specifically, as the number of loci increases, higher-order epistatic interactions become increasingly important in these models, with an increasing fraction of the genetic variance becoming nonadditive, contrary to empirical observations. As shown by Barton and Turelli (2004), without dominance, conversion of nonadditive to additive variance depends only on the variance components and not on the number of loci per se. Numerical results indicating that more inbreeding is needed to produce maximal release of additive variance with more loci follow directly from our analytical results, which show that high levels of inbreeding (F > 0.5) are needed for significant conversion of higher-order components. We discuss alternative approaches to modeling multilocus epistasis and understanding its consequences.},

title = {A general framework for weighted gene co-expression network analysis},
abstract = {Gene co-expression networks are increasingly used to explore the system-level functionality of genes. The network construction is conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are connected if the corresponding genes are significantly co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes in such networks. An important question is whether it is biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general framework for ;soft' thresholding that assigns a connection weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we propose several adjacency functions that convert the co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology criterion).We generalize the following important network concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence that they can be important for predicting the biological significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the ;weighted' topological overlap measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive modules than its ;unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard thresholding.We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.},

title = {A haplotype-based algorithm for multilocus linkage disequilibrium mapping of quantitative trait loci with epistasis},
abstract = {For tightly linked loci, cosegregation may lead to nonrandom associations between alleles in a population. Because of its evolutionary relationship with linkage, this phenomenon is called linkage disequilibrium. Today, linkage disequilibrium-based mapping has become a major focus of recent genome research into mapping complex traits. In this article, we present a new statistical method for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) of additive, dominant, and epistatic effects in equilibrium natural populations. Our method is based on haplotype analysis of multilocus linkage disequilibrium and exhibits two significant advantages over current disequilibrium mapping methods. First, we have derived closed-form solutions for estimating the marker-QTL haplotype frequencies within the maximum-likelihood framework implemented by the EM algorithm. The allele frequencies of putative QTL and their linkage disequilibria with the markers are estimated by solving a system of regular equations. This procedure has significantly improved the computational efficiency and the precision of parameter estimation. Second, our method can detect marker-QTL disequilibria of different orders and QTL epistatic interactions of various kinds on the basis of a multilocus analysis. This can not only enhance the precision of parameter estimation, but also make it possible to perform whole-genome association studies. We carried out extensive simulation studies to examine the robustness and statistical performance of our method. The application of the new method was validated using a case study from humans, in which we successfully detected significant QTL affecting human body heights. Finally, we discuss the implications of our method for genome projects and its extension to a broader circumstance. The computer program for the method proposed in this article is available at the webpage http://www.ifasstat.ufl.edu/genome/~LD.},

This progress has been driven largely by empirical results, and most useful theoretical work has concentrated on making sense of empirical patterns. Given the complexity of speciation, mathematical theory is subordinate to verbal theory and generalizations about data. Nevertheless, mathematical theory can provide a useful classification of verbal theories; can help determine the biological plausibility of verbal theories; can determine whether alternative mechanisms of speciation are consistent with empirical patterns; and can occasionally provide predictions that go beyond empirical generalizations. We discuss recent examples of progress in each of these areas.},

Between 25,000-140,000 amplified sequences were obtained per sample. Profound baseline V3 loop sequence heterogeneity existed; predicted CXCR4-using populations were identified in a largely CCR5-using population. The V3 loop forms associated with subsequent virologic failure, either through CXCR4 use or the emergence of high-level VVC resistance, were present as minor variants at 0.8-2.8% of baseline samples. Extreme, rapid shifts in population frequencies toward these forms occurred, and deep sequencing provided a detailed view of the rapid evolutionary impact of VVC selection. Greater V3 diversity was observed post-selection. This previously unreported degree of V3 loop sequence diversity has implications for viral pathogenesis, vaccine design, and the optimal use of HIV-1 CCR5 antagonists.},

The methods are often interpreted as removing that part of the regression or correlation that is an artifact due to phylogeny and there is an expectation that the corrected regression or correlation coefficients will usually be closer to zero. It is shown here that this is not an accurate way to interpret these methods. The effect of taking phylogeny into account is to reduce the variance of the estimated regression or correlation coefficients. Their means are not because since estimates of regression coefficients are unbiased whether or not the correct phylogeny is taken into account.

abstract = {The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population is characterised by extensive genetic variability that results from high error and recombination rates of the reverse transcription process, and from the fast turnover of virions in HIV-infected individuals. Among the viral variants encountered at the global scale, recombinant forms are extremely abundant. Some of these recombinants (known as circulating recombinant forms) become fixed and undergo rapid expansion in the population. The reasons underlying their epidemiological success remain at present poorly understood and constitute a fascinating area for future research to improve our understanding of immune escape, pathogenicity and transmission. Recombinant viruses are generated during reverse transcription as a consequence of template switching between the two genetically different genomic RNAs present in a heterozygous virus. Recombination can thereby generate shortcuts in evolution by producing mosaic reverse transcription products of parental genomes. Therefore, in a single infectious cycle multiple mutations that are positively selected can be combined or, conversely, negatively selected mutations can be removed. Recombination is therefore involved in different aspects of HIV evolution, adaptation to its host, and escape from antiviral treatments.},

title = {Multiple Fitness Peaks and Epistasis},
abstract = {The importance of genetic interactions in the evolutionary process has been debated for more than half a century. Genetic interactions such as underdominance and epistasis (the interaction among genetic loci in their effects on phenotypes or fitness) can play a special role in the evolutionary process because they can create multiple fitness optima (adaptive peaks) separated by fitness minima (adaptive valleys). The valleys prevent deterministic evolution from one peak to another. We review the evidence that genetic interaction is a common phenomenon in natural populations. Some studies give strong circumstantial evidence for multiple fitness peaks, although the mapping of epistatic interactions onto fitness surfaces remains incompletely explored, and absolute proof that multiple peaks exist can be shown to be empirically impossible. We show that there are many reasons that epistatic polymorphism is very difficult to find, even when interactions are an extremely important part of the genetic system. When polymorphism results in the presence of multiple fitness peaks within a group of interbreeding populations, one fitness peak will quickly be nearly fixed within all interbreeding populations, but when epistatic or underdominant loci are nearly fixed, there will be no direct evidence of genetic interaction. Thus when complex landscapes are evolutionarily most important, evidence for alternative high fitness genetic combinations will be most ephemeral. Genetic interactions have been most clearly demonstrated in wide crosses within species and among closely related species. This evidence suggests that genetic interactions may play an important role in taxonomic diversification and species-level constraints. Population genetic analyses linked with new approaches in metabolic and molecular genetic research are likely to provide exciting new insights into the role of gene interactions in the evolutionary process.},

title = {Optimization of DNA polymerase mutation rates during bacterial evolution},
abstract = {Mutation rate is an important determinant of evolvability. The optimal mutation rate for different organisms during evolution has been modeled in silico and tested in vivo, predominantly through pairwise comparisons. To characterize the fitness landscape across a broad range of mutation rates, we generated a panel of 66 DNA polymerase I mutants in Escherichia coli with comparable growth properties, yet with differing DNA replication fidelities, spanning 10(3)-fold higher and lower than that of wild type. These strains were competed for 350 generations in six replicate cultures in two different environments. A narrow range of mutation rates, 10- to 47-fold greater than that of wild type, predominated after serial passage. Mutants exhibiting higher mutation rates were not detected, nor were wild-type or antimutator strains. Winning clones exhibited shorter doubling times, greater maximum culture densities, and a growth advantages in pairwise competition relative to their precompetition ancestors, indicating the acquisition of adaptive phenotypes. To investigate the basis for mutator selection, we undertook a large series of pairwise competitions between mutator and wild-type strains under conditions where, in most cases, one strain completely overtook the culture within 18 days. Mutators were the most frequent winners but wild-type strains were also observed winning, suggesting that the competitive advantage of mutators is due to a greater probability of developing selectably advantageous mutations rather than from an initial growth advantage conferred by the polymerase variant itself. Our results indicate that under conditions where organism fitness is not yet maximized for a particular environment, competitive adaptation may be facilitated by enhanced mutagenesis.},

title = {The genetic basis of adaptive population differentiation: a quantitative trait locus analysis of fitness traits in two wild barley populations from contrasting habitats},
abstract = {We used a quantitative trait locus (QTL) approach to study the genetic basis of population differentiation in wild barley, Hordeum spontaneum. Several ecotypes are recognized in this model species, and population genetic studies and reciprocal transplant experiments have indicated the role of local adaptation in shaping population differences. We derived a mapping population from a cross between a coastal Mediterranean population and a steppe inland population from Israel and assessed F3 progeny fitness in the natural growing environments of the two parental populations. Dilution of the local gene pool, estimated as the proportion of native alleles at 96 marker loci in the recombinant lines, negatively affected fitness traits at both sites. QTLs for fitness traits tended to differ in the magnitude but not in the direction of their effects across sites, with beneficial alleles generally conferring a greater fitness advantage at their native site. Several QTLs showed fitness effects at one site only, but no opposite selection on individual QTLs was observed across the sites. In a common-garden experiment, we explored the hypothesis that the two populations have adapted to divergent nutrient availabilities. In the different nutrient environments of this experiment, but not under field conditions, fitness of the F3 progeny lines increased with the number of heterozygous marker loci. Comparison of QTL-effects that underlie genotype x nutrient interaction in the common-garden experiment and genotype x site interaction in the field suggested that population differentiation at the field sites may have been driven by divergent nutrient availabilities to a limited extent. Also in this experiment no QTLs were observed with opposite fitness effects in contrasting environments. Our data are consistent with the view that adaptive differentiation can be based on selection on multiple traits changing gradually along ecological gradients. This can occur without QTLs showing opposite fitness effects in the different environments, that is, in the absence of genetic trade-offs in performance between environments.},

title = {The evolution of one- and two-locus systems},
abstract = {Assuming age-independent fertilities and mortalities and random mating, continuous-time models for a monoecious population are investigated for weak selection. A single locus with multiple alleles and two alleles at each of two loci are considered. A slow-selection analysis of diallelic and multiallelic two-locus models with discrete nonoverlapping generations is also presented. The selective differences may be functions of genotypic frequencies, but their rate of change due to their explicit dependence on time (if any) must be at most of the second order in s, (i.e., O(s2), where s is the intensity of natural selection. Then, after several generations have elapsed, in the continuous time models the time-derivative of the deviations from Hardy-Weinberg proportions is of O(s2), and in the two-locus models the rate of change of the linkage disequilibrium is of O(s2). It follows that, if the rate of change of the genotypic fitnesses is smaller than second order in s (i.e., o(s2)), then to O(s2) the rate of change of the mean fitness of the population is equal to the genic variance. For a fixed value of s, however, no matter how small, the genic variance may occasionally be smaller in absolute value than the (possibly negative) lower order terms in the change in fitness, and hence the mean fitness may decrease. This happens if the allelic frequencies are changing extremely slowly, and hence occurs often very close to equilibrium. Some new expressions are derived for the change in mean fitness. It is shown that, with an error of O(s), the genotypic frequencies evolve as if the population were in Hardy-Weinberg proportions and linkage equilibrium. Thus, at least for the deterministic behaviour of one and two loci, deviations from random combination appear to have very little evolutionary significance.},

title = {Systematic determination of patterns of gene expression during Drosophila embryogenesis},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cell-fate specification and tissue differentiation during development are largely achieved by the regulation of gene transcription. RESULTS: As a first step to creating a comprehensive atlas of gene-expression patterns during Drosophila embryogenesis, we examined 2,179 genes by in situ hybridization to fixed Drosophila embryos. Of the genes assayed, 63.7% displayed dynamic expression patterns that were documented with 25,690 digital photomicrographs of individual embryos. The photomicrographs were annotated using controlled vocabularies for anatomical structures that are organized into a developmental hierarchy. We also generated a detailed time course of gene expression during embryogenesis using microarrays to provide an independent corroboration of the in situ hybridization results. All image, annotation and microarray data are stored in publicly available database. We found that the RNA transcripts of about 1% of genes show clear subcellular localization. Nearly all the annotated expression patterns are distinct. We present an approach for organizing the data by hierarchical clustering of annotation terms that allows us to group tissues that express similar sets of genes as well as genes displaying similar expression patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Analyzing gene-expression patterns by in situ hybridization to whole-mount embryos provides an extremely rich dataset that can be used to identify genes involved in developmental processes that have been missed by traditional genetic analysis. Systematic analysis of rigorously annotated patterns of gene expression will complement and extend the types of analyses carried out using expression microarrays.},

abstract = {Hemiascomycete yeasts cover an evolutionary span comparable to that of the entire phylum of chordates. Since this group currently contains the largest number of complete genome sequences it presents unique opportunities to understand the evolution of genome organization in eukaryotes. We inferred rates of genome instability on all branches of a phylogenetic tree for 11 species and calculated species-specific rates of genome rearrangements. We characterized all inversion events that occurred within synteny blocks between six representatives of the different lineages. We show that the rates of macro- and microrearrangements of gene order are correlated within individual lineages but are highly variable across different lineages. The most unstable genomes correspond to the pathogenic yeasts Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. Chromosomal maps have been intensively shuffled by numerous interchromosomal rearrangements, even between species that have retained a very high physical fraction of their genomes within small synteny blocks. Despite this intensive reshuffling of gene positions, essential genes, which cluster in low recombination regions in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, tend to remain syntenic during evolution. This work reveals that the high plasticity of eukaryotic genomes results from rearrangement rates that vary between lineages but also at different evolutionary times of a given lineage.},

title = {Silent mutations are selected in {HIV}-1 reverse transcriptase and affect enzymatic efficiency},
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Missense mutations in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase are frequently selected in response to therapy; we examined whether silent mutations were also selected for by HIV therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational analysis. Biochemical assays. METHODS: A comparison of the reverse transcriptase gene, from antiretroviral- naive (N = 812) and experienced individuals (N = 2212), reveals two silent mutations (K65K and K66K) that are strongly associated with treatment experience. To assess reverse transcription efficiency, steady-state kinetic assays were carried out using recombinant purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and a series of synthetic RNA/DNA template/primer substrates. The RNA templates spanned codons 60-77 in the reverse transcriptase and included different combinations of mutations at codons 65, 66, 67, and 70. RESULTS: Silent AAG mutations (or mixtures) at reverse transcriptase codons 65 and/or 66 were observed in 812 samples from 351 patients and 2129 samples from 829 patients, respectively. In clade B samples, there was a very strong relationship between the silent mutations and the thymidine analogue mutations, in particular D67N. Steady-state kinetic experiments demonstrated that HIV-1 reverse transcriptase exhibited a strong tendency to pause and/or dissociate at codons 65 and 66 on RNA templates that contained the D67N and K70R mutations. However, when the K66 or K66 AAA to AAG mutations were added to the background of the 67 and 70 mutational changes, these pausing and/or dissociation events were largely alleviated. CONCLUSION: Silent mutations at codons 65 and/or 66 are strongly coselected with thymidine analogue mutations. These data provide the first evidence for an RNA-level mechanism of direct relevance to drug resistance.},

title = {Muller's ratchet and the pattern of variation at a neutral locus},
abstract = {The levels and patterns of variation at a neutral locus are analyzed in a haploid asexual population undergoing accumulation of deleterious mutations due to Muller's ratchet. We find that the movement of Muller's ratchet can be associated with a considerable reduction in genetic diversity below classical neutral expectation. The extent to which variability is reduced is a function of the deleterious mutation rate, the fitness effects of the mutations, and the population size. Approximate analytical expressions for the expected genetic diversity are compared with simulation results under two different models of deleterious mutations: a model where all deleterious mutations have equal effects and a model where there are two classes of deleterious mutations. We also find that Muller's ratchet can produce a considerable distortion in the neutral frequency spectrum toward an excess of rare variants.},

title = {Whole-genome analysis of human influenza A virus reveals multiple persistent lineages and reassortment among recent H3N2 viruses},
abstract = {Understanding the evolution of influenza A viruses in humans is important for surveillance and vaccine strain selection. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of 156 complete genomes of human H3N2 influenza A viruses collected between 1999 and 2004 from New York State, United States, and observed multiple co-circulating clades with different population frequencies. Strikingly, phylogenies inferred for individual gene segments revealed that multiple reassortment events had occurred among these clades, such that one clade of H3N2 viruses present at least since 2000 had provided the hemagglutinin gene for all those H3N2 viruses sampled after the 2002-2003 influenza season. This reassortment event was the likely progenitor of the antigenically variant influenza strains that caused the A/Fujian/411/2002-like epidemic of the 2003-2004 influenza season. However, despite sharing the same hemagglutinin, these phylogenetically distinct lineages of viruses continue to co-circulate in the same population. These data, derived from the first large-scale analysis of H3N2 viruses, convincingly demonstrate that multiple lineages can co-circulate, persist, and reassort in epidemiologically significant ways, and underscore the importance of genomic analyses for future influenza surveillance.},

title = {RNA-mediated epigenetic programming of a genome-rearrangement pathway},
abstract = {Genome-wide DNA rearrangements occur in many eukaryotes but are most exaggerated in ciliates, making them ideal model systems for epigenetic phenomena. During development of the somatic macronucleus, Oxytricha trifallax destroys 95% of its germ line, severely fragmenting its chromosomes, and then unscrambles hundreds of thousands of remaining fragments by permutation or inversion. Here we demonstrate that DNA or RNA templates can orchestrate these genome rearrangements in Oxytricha, supporting an epigenetic model for sequence-dependent comparison between germline and somatic genomes. A complete RNA cache of the maternal somatic genome may be available at a specific stage during development to provide a template for correct and precise DNA rearrangement. We show the existence of maternal RNA templates that could guide DNA assembly, and that disruption of specific RNA molecules disables rearrangement of the corresponding gene. Injection of artificial templates reprogrammes the DNA rearrangement pathway, suggesting that RNA molecules guide genome rearrangement.},

abstract = {The ability to detect recent natural selection in the human population would have profound implications for the study of human history and for medicine. Here, we introduce a framework for detecting the genetic imprint of recent positive selection by analysing long-range haplotypes in human populations. We first identify haplotypes at a locus of interest (core haplotypes). We then assess the age of each core haplotype by the decay of its association to alleles at various distances from the locus, as measured by extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH). Core haplotypes that have unusually high EHH and a high population frequency indicate the presence of a mutation that rose to prominence in the human gene pool faster than expected under neutral evolution. We applied this approach to investigate selection at two genes carrying common variants implicated in resistance to malaria: G6PD and CD40 ligand. At both loci, the core haplotypes carrying the proposed protective mutation stand out and show significant evidence of selection. More generally, the method could be used to scan the entire genome for evidence of recent positive selection.},

abstract = {Genome size, a fundamental aspect of any organism, is subject to a variety of mutational and selection pressures. We investigated genome size evolution in haploid, diploid, and tetraploid initially isogenic lines of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Over the course of approximately 1,800 generations of mitotic division, we observed convergence toward diploid DNA content in all replicate lines. This convergence was observed in both unstressful and stressful environments, although the rate of convergence was dependent on initial ploidy and evolutionary environment. Comparative genomic hybridization with microarrays revealed nearly euploid DNA content by the end of the experiment. As the vegetative life cycle of S. cerevisiae is predominantly diploid, this experiment provides evidence that genome size evolution is constrained, with selection favouring the genomic content typical of the yeast's evolutionary past.},

title = {Refractory periods and climate forcing in cholera dynamics},
abstract = {Outbreaks of many infectious diseases, including cholera, malaria and dengue, vary over characteristic periods longer than 1 year. Evidence that climate variability drives these interannual cycles has been highly controversial, chiefly because it is difficult to isolate the contribution of environmental forcing while taking into account nonlinear epidemiological dynamics generated by mechanisms such as host immunity. Here we show that a critical interplay of environmental forcing, specifically climate variability, and temporary immunity explains the interannual disease cycles present in a four-decade cholera time series from Matlab, Bangladesh. We reconstruct the transmission rate, the key epidemiological parameter affected by extrinsic forcing, over time for the predominant strain (El Tor) with a nonlinear population model that permits a contributing effect of intrinsic immunity. Transmission shows clear interannual variability with a strong correspondence to climate patterns at long periods (over 7 years, for monsoon rains and Brahmaputra river discharge) and at shorter periods (under 7 years, for flood extent in Bangladesh, sea surface temperatures in the Bay of Bengal and the El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation). The importance of the interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic factors in determining disease dynamics is illustrated during refractory periods, when population susceptibility levels are low as the result of immunity and the size of cholera outbreaks only weakly reflects climate forcing.},

We describe how evolvability can be an object of Darwinian selection, emphasizing the collective nature of the process. We quantify our theory with computer simulations of protein evolution. These simulations demonstrate that rapid or dramatic environmental change leads to selection for greater evolvability. The selective pressure for large-scale genetic moves such as DNA exchange becomes increasingly strong as the environmental conditions become more uncertain. Our results demonstrate that evolvability is a selectable trait and allow for the explanation of a large body of experimental results.},

This model is motivated by the process of bacterial transformation. We solve for the velocity, the rate of increase of fitness, as a function of the fixed population size, N.

title = {The hitchhiking effect on linkage disequilibrium between linked neutral loci},
abstract = {We analyzed a three-locus model of genetic hitchhiking with one locus experiencing positive directional selection and two partially linked neutral loci. Following the original hitchhiking approach by Maynard Smith and Haigh, our analysis is purely deterministic. In the first half of the selected phase after a favored mutation has entered the population, hitchhiking may lead to a strong increase of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the two neutral sites if both are <0.1 s away from the selected site (where s is the selection coefficient). In the second half of the selected phase, the main effect of hitchhiking is to destroy LD. This occurs very quickly (before the end of the selected phase) when the selected site is between both neutral loci. This pattern cannot be attributed to the well-known variation-reducing effect of hitchhiking but is a consequence of secondary hitchhiking effects on the recombinants created in the selected phase. When the selected site is outside the neutral loci (which are, say, <0.1s apart), however, a fast decay of LD is observed only if the selected site is in the immediate neighborhood of one of the neutral sites (i.e., if the recombination rate r between the selected site and one of the neutral sites satisfies r<<0.1 s). If the selected site is far away from the neutral sites (say, r > 0.3 s), the decay rate of LD approaches that of neutrality. Averaging over a uniform distribution of initial gamete frequencies shows that the expected LD at the end of the hitchhiking phase is driven toward zero, while the variance is increased when the selected site is well outside the two neutral sites. When the direction of LD is polarized with respect to the more common allele at each neutral site, hitchhiking creates more positive than negative linkage disequilibrium. Thus, hitchhiking may have a distinctively patterned LD-reducing effect, in particular near the target of selection.},

abstract = {In 1991, Barton and Turelli developed recursions to describe the evolution of multilocus systems under arbitrary forms of selection. This article generalizes their approach to allow for arbitrary modes of inheritance, including diploidy, polyploidy, sex linkage, cytoplasmic inheritance, and genomic imprinting. The framework is also extended to allow for other deterministic evolutionary forces, including migration and mutation. Exact recursions that fully describe the state of the population are presented; these are implemented in a computer algebra package (available on the Web at http://helios.bto.ed.ac.uk/evolgen). Despite the generality of our framework, it can describe evolutionary dynamics exactly by just two equations. These recursions can be further simplified using a "quasi-linkage equilibrium" (QLE) approximation. We illustrate the methods by finding the effect of natural selection, sexual selection, mutation, and migration on the genetic composition of a population.},

abstract = {The loss of a specified allele and the convergence of the gene frequencies at a single multiallelic locus under the joint action of migration and viability selection are investigated. The monoecious, diploid population is subdivided into finitely many panmictic colonies that exchange adult migrants independently of genotype. Sufficient conditions are established for global fixation and for global loss of a particular allele. When migration is either sufficiently weak or sufficiently strong relative to selection, the equilibria are described, convergence of the gene frequencies is demonstrated, and sufficient conditions for the increase of a suitably defined mean fitness are offered. If the selection pattern is the same in every colony and such that in a panmictic population there is a globally asymptotically stable, internal (i.e., completely polymorphic) equilibrium point, then under certain weak assumptions on migration, the gene frequencies in the subdivided population converge globally to that equilibrium point. Thus, in this case, the ultimate state of the population is unaffected by geographical structure.},

abstract = {Recent theoretical studies of the adaptation of DNA sequences assume that the distribution of fitness effects among new beneficial mutations is exponential. This has been justified by using extreme value theory and, in particular, by assuming that the distribution of fitnesses belongs to the Gumbel domain of attraction. However, extreme value theory shows that two other domains of attraction are also possible: the Fr{\'e}chet and Weibull domains. Distributions in the Fr{\'e}chet domain have right tails that are heavier than exponential, while distributions in the Weibull domain have right tails that are truncated. To explore the consequences of relaxing the Gumbel assumption, we generalize previous adaptation theory to allow all three domains. We find that many of the previously derived Gumbel-based predictions about the first step of adaptation are fairly robust for some moderate forms of right tails in the Weibull and Fr{\'e}chet domains, but significant departures are possible, especially for predictions concerning multiple steps in adaptation.},

title = {Optimizing imaging parameters for the separation of multiple labels in a fluorescence image},
abstract = {A theoretical analysis is presented on how to separate the contributions from individual, simultaneously present fluorophores in a spectrally resolved image. Equations are derived that allow the calculation of the signal-to-noise ratio of the estimates for such contributions, given the spectral information on the individual fluorophores, the excitation wavelengths and intensities, and the number and widths of the spectral detection channels. We then ask how such imaging parameters have to be chosen for optimal fluorophore separation. We optimize the signal-to-noise ratio or optimize a newly defined 'figure of merit', which is a measure of efficiency in the use of emitted photons. The influence of photobleaching on the resolution and on the choice of imaging parameters is discussed, as well as the additional resolution gained by including fluorescence lifetime information. A surprisingly small number of spectral channels are required for an almost optimal resolution, if the borders of these channels are optimally selected. The detailed consideration of photobleaching is found to be essential, whenever there is significant bleaching. Consideration of fluorescence lifetime information (in addition to spectral information) improves results, particularly when lifetimes differ by more than a factor of two.},

title = {Nonequilibrium dynamics of random field Ising spin chains: exact results via real space renormalization group},
abstract = {The nonequilibrium dynamics of classical random Ising spin chains with nonconserved magnetization are studied using an asymptotically exact real space renormalization group (RSRG). We focus on random field Ising model (RFIM) spin chains with and without a uniform applied field, as well as on Ising spin glass chains in an applied field. For the RFIM we consider a universal regime where the random field and the temperature are both much smaller than the exchange coupling. In this regime, the Imry-Ma length that sets the scale of the equilibrium correlations is large and the coarsening of domains from random initial conditions (e.g., a quench from high temperature) occurs over a wide range of length scales. The two types of domain walls that occur diffuse in opposite random potentials, of the form studied by Sinai, and domain walls annihilate when they meet. Using the RSRG we compute many universal asymptotic properties of both the nonequilibrium dynamics and the equilibrium limit. We find that the configurations of the domain walls converge rapidly toward a set of system-specific time-dependent positions that are independent of the initial conditions. Thus the behavior of this nonequilibrium system is pseudodeterministic at long times because of the broad distributions of barriers that occur on the long length scales involved. Specifically, we obtain the time dependence of the energy, the magnetization, and the distribution of domain sizes (found to be statistically independent). The equilibrium limits agree with known exact results. We obtain the exact scaling form of the two-point equal time correlation function <S0(t)Sx(t)> and the two-time autocorrelations <S0(t('))S0(t)>. We also compute the persistence properties of a single spin, of local magnetization, and of domains. The analogous quantities for the +/-J Ising spin glass in an applied field are obtained from the RFIM via a gauge transformation. In addition to these we compute the two-point two-time correlation function <S0(t)Sx(t)><S0(t('))Sx(t('))> which can in principle be measured by experiments on spin-glass-like systems. The thermal fluctuations are studied and found to be dominated by rare events; in particular all moments of truncated equal time correlations are computed. Physical properties which are typically measured in aging experiments are also studied, focusing on the response to a small magnetic field which is applied after waiting for the system to equilibrate for a time t(w). The nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation ratio X(t,t(w)) is computed. We find that for (t-t(w)) approximately t(alpha)(w) with alpha;<1, the ratio equal to its equilibrium value X=1, although time translational invariance does not hold in this regime. For t-t(w) approximately t(w) the ratio exhibits an aging regime with a nontrivial X=X(t/t(w)) not equal to 1, but the behavior is markedly different from mean field theory. Finally the distribution of the total magnetization and of the number of domains is computed for large finite size systems. General issues about convergence toward equilibrium and the possibilities of weakly history-dependent evolution in other random systems are discussed.},

abstract = {Ten years have passed since the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae-more precisely, the S288c strain-was completely sequenced. However, experimental work in yeast is commonly performed using strains that are of unknown genetic relationship to S288c. Here, we characterized the nucleotide-level similarity between S288c and seven commonly used lab strains (A364A, W303, FL100, CEN.PK, summation 1278b, SK1 and BY4716) using 25mer oligonucleotide microarrays that provide complete and redundant coverage of the approximately 12 Mb Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. Using these data, we assessed the frequency and distribution of nucleotide variation in comparison to the sequenced reference genome. These data allow us to infer the relationships between experimentally important strains of yeast and provide insight for experimental designs that are sensitive to sequence variation. We propose a rational approach for near complete sequencing of strains related to the reference using these data and directed re-sequencing.

title = {Emergence of recombinant forms of {HIV}: dynamics and scaling},
abstract = {The ability to accelerate the accumulation of favorable combinations of mutations renders recombination a potent force underlying the emergence of forms of HIV that escape multi-drug therapy and specific host immune responses. We present a mathematical model that describes the dynamics of the emergence of recombinant forms of HIV following infection with diverse viral genomes. Mimicking recent in vitro experiments, we consider target cells simultaneously exposed to two distinct, homozygous viral populations and construct dynamical equations that predict the time evolution of populations of uninfected, singly infected, and doubly infected cells, and homozygous, heterozygous, and recombinant viruses. Model predictions capture several recent experimental observations quantitatively and provide insights into the role of recombination in HIV dynamics. From analyses of data from single-round infection experiments with our description of the probability with which recombination accumulates distinct mutations present on the two genomic strands in a virion, we estimate that approximately 8 recombinational strand transfer events occur on average (95% confidence interval: 6-10) during reverse transcription of HIV in T cells. Model predictions of virus and cell dynamics describe the time evolution and the relative prevalence of various infected cell subpopulations following the onset of infection observed experimentally. Remarkably, model predictions are in quantitative agreement with the experimental scaling relationship that the percentage of cells infected with recombinant genomes is proportional to the percentage of cells coinfected with the two genomes employed at the onset of infection. Our model thus presents an accurate description of the influence of recombination on HIV dynamics in vitro. When distinctions between different viral genomes are ignored, our model reduces to the standard model of viral dynamics, which successfully predicts viral load changes in HIV patients undergoing therapy. Our model may thus serve as a useful framework to predict the emergence of multi-drug-resistant forms of HIV in infected individuals.},

title = {The Polymorphism Frequency Spectrum of Finitely Many Sites under Selection},
abstract = {The distribution of genetic polymorphisms in a population contains information about evolutionary processes. The Poisson Random Field (PRF) model uses the polymorphism frequency spectrum to infer the mutation rate and the strength of directional selection. The PRF model relies on an infinite-sites approximation that is reasonable for most eukaryotic populations, but that becomes problematic when Theta is large (Theta / greater, similar 0.05). Here, we show that at large mutation rates characteristic of microbes and viruses the infinite-sites approximation of the PRF model induces systematic biases that lead it to underestimate negative selection pressures and mutation rates, and erroneously infer positive selection. We introduce two new methods that extend our ability to infer selection pressures and mutation rates at large Theta: a finite-site modification of the PRF model, and a new technique based on diffusion theory. Our methods can be used to infer not only a "weighted average" of selection pressures acting on a gene sequence, but also the distribution of selection pressures across sites. We evaluate the accuracy of our methods, as well that of the original PRF approach, by comparison with Wright-Fisher simulations.},

title = {High-resolution mapping of expression-QTLs yields insight into human gene regulation},
abstract = {Recent studies of the HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines have identified large numbers of quantitative trait loci for gene expression (eQTLs). Reanalyzing these data using a novel Bayesian hierarchical model, we were able to create a surprisingly high-resolution map of the typical locations of sites that affect mRNA levels in cis. Strikingly, we found a strong enrichment of eQTLs in the 250 bp just upstream of the transcription end site (TES), in addition to an enrichment around the transcription start site (TSS). Most eQTLs lie either within genes or close to genes; for example, we estimate that only 5% of eQTLs lie more than 20 kb upstream of the TSS. After controlling for position effects, SNPs in exons are approximately 2-fold more likely than SNPs in introns to be eQTLs. Our results suggest an important role for mRNA stability in determining steady-state mRNA levels, and highlight the potential of eQTL mapping as a high-resolution tool for studying the determinants of gene regulation.},

title = {Stochastic switching as a survival strategy in fluctuating environments},
abstract = {A classic problem in population and evolutionary biology is to understand how a population optimizes its fitness in fluctuating environments. A population might enhance its fitness by allowing individual cells to stochastically transition among multiple phenotypes, thus ensuring that some cells are always prepared for an unforeseen environmental fluctuation. Here we experimentally explore how switching affects population growth by using the galactose utilization network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We engineered a strain that randomly transitions between two phenotypes as a result of stochastic gene expression. Each phenotype was designed to confer a growth advantage over the other phenotype in a certain environment. When we compared the growth of two populations with different switching rates, we found that fast-switching populations outgrow slow switchers when the environment fluctuates rapidly, whereas slow-switching phenotypes outgrow fast switchers when the environment changes rarely. These results suggest that cells may tune inter-phenotype switching rates to the frequency of environmental changes.},

abstract = {The genomes of individuals from the same species vary in sequence as a result of different evolutionary processes. To examine the patterns of, and the forces shaping, sequence variation in Arabidopsis thaliana, we performed high-density array resequencing of 20 diverse strains (accessions). More than 1 million nonredundant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified at moderate false discovery rates (FDRs), and approximately 4% of the genome was identified as being highly dissimilar or deleted relative to the reference genome sequence. Patterns of polymorphism are highly nonrandom among gene families, with genes mediating interaction with the biotic environment having exceptional polymorphism levels. At the chromosomal scale, regional variation in polymorphism was readily apparent. A scan for recent selective sweeps revealed several candidate regions, including a notable example in which almost all variation was removed in a 500-kilobase window. Analyzing the polymorphisms we describe in larger sets of accessions will enable a detailed understanding of forces shaping population-wide sequence variation in A. thaliana.},

We tested an array of 12 selected lines, including 10 from a Massachusetts population (5 divergently selected pairs) and 2 from a California population (1 divergently selected pair). In the Massachusetts replicates, 29 loci showed consistent, significant expression differences in all 5 line-pair comparisons. However, the significant loci in the California lines were almost completely different from these. The disparity between responding genes in different gene pools confirms recent evidence that surprisingly large numbers of loci can affect wing shape. Our results also show that with well-replicated selection lines, of large effective size, the numbers of candidate genes in microarray-based searches can be reduced to realistic levels.},

title = {The evolution of sex and recombination in response to abiotic or coevolutionary fluctuations in epistasis},
abstract = {Evolutionary biologists have identified several factors that could explain the widespread phenomena of sex and recombination. One hypothesis is that host-parasite interactions favor sex and recombination because they favor the production of rare genotypes. A problem with many of the early models of this so-called Red Queen hypothesis is that several factors are acting together: directional selection, fluctuating epistasis, and drift. It is thus difficult to identify what exactly is selecting for sex in these models. Is one factor more important than the others or is it the synergistic action of these different factors that really matters? Here we focus on the analysis of a simple model with a single mechanism that might select for sex: fluctuating epistasis. We first analyze the evolution of sex and recombination when the temporal fluctuations are driven by the abiotic environment. We then analyze the evolution of sex and recombination in a two-species coevolutionary model, where directional selection is absent (allele frequencies remain fixed) and temporal variation in epistasis is induced by coevolution with the antagonist species. In both cases we contrast situations with weak and strong selection and derive the evolutionarily stable (ES) recombination rate. The ES recombination rate is most sensitive to the period of the cycles, which in turn depends on the strength of epistasis. In particular, more virulent parasites cause more rapid cycles and consequently increase the ES recombination rate of the host. Although the ES strategy is maximized at an intermediate period, some recombination is favored even when fluctuations are very slow. By contrast, the amplitude of the cycles has no effect on the ES level of sex and recombination, unless sex and recombination are costly, in which case higher-amplitude cycles allow the evolution of higher rates of sex and recombination. In the coevolutionary model, the amount of recombination in the interacting species also has a large effect on the ES, with evolution favoring higher rates of sex and recombination than in the interacting species. In general, the ES recombination rate is less than or equal to the recombination rate that would maximize mean fitness. We also discuss the effect of migration when sex and recombination evolve in a metapopulation. We find that intermediate parasite migration rates maximize the degree of local adaptation of the parasite and lead to a higher ES recombination rate in the host.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Classical models of gene flow fail in three ways: they cannot explain large-scale patterns; they predict much more genetic diversity than is observed; and they assume that loosely linked genetic loci evolve independently. We propose a new model that deals with these problems. Extinction events kill some fraction of individuals in a region. These are replaced by offspring from a small number of parents, drawn from the pre-existing population. This model of evolution forwards in time corresponds to a backwards model, in which ancestral lineages jump to a new location if they are hit by an event, and may coalesce with other lineages that are hit by the same event. We derive an expression for the identity in allelic state, and show that, over scales much larger than the largest event, this converges to the classical value derived by Wright and Mal{\'e}cot. However, rare events that cover large areas cause low genetic diversity, large-scale patterns, and correlations in ancestry between unlinked loci.},

title = {Correlations among amino acid sites in bHLH protein domains: an information theoretic analysis},
abstract = {An information theoretic approach is used to examine the magnitude and origin of associations among amino acid sites in the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors. Entropy and mutual information values are used to summarize the variability and covariability of amino acids comprising the bHLH domain for 242 sequences. When these quantitative measures are integrated with crystal structure data and summarized using helical wheels, they provide important insights into the evolution of three-dimensional structure in these proteins. We show that amino acid sites in the bHLH domain known to pack against each other have very low entropy values, indicating little residue diversity at these contact sites. Noncontact sites, on the other hand, exhibit significantly larger entropy values, as well as statistically significant levels of mutual information or association among sites. High levels of mutual information indicate significant amounts of intercorrelation among amino acid residues at these various sites. Using computer simulations based on a parametric bootstrap procedure, we are able to partition the observed covariation among various amino acid sites into that arising from phylogenetic (common ancestry) and stochastic causes and those resulting from structural and functional constraints. These results show that a significant amount of the observed covariation among amino acid sites is due to structural/functional constraints, over and above the covariation arising from phylogenetic constraints. These quantitative analyses provide a highly integrated evolutionary picture of the multidimensional dynamics of sequence diversity and protein structure.},

abstract = {During vertebrate development, the temporal control of Hox gene transcriptional activation follows the genomic order of the genes within the Hox clusters. Although it is recognized that this "Hox clock" serves to coordinate body patterning, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. We have shown that successive Hox gene activation in the mouse embryo is closely associated with a directional transition in chromatin status, as judged by the dynamic progression of transcription-competent modifications: Increases in activation marks correspond to decreases in repressive marks. Furthermore, using a mouse in which a Hox cluster was split into two pieces, we document the necessity to maintain a clustered organization to properly implement this process. These results suggest that chromatin modifications are important parameters in the temporal regulation of this gene family.},

The protein and DNA state dynamics are treated stochastically and on an equal footing. In this approach the mean influence of the proteomic cloud created by one gene on the action of another is self-consistently computed. Within this approximation a broad range of stochastic genetic switches may be solved exactly in terms of finding the probability distribution and its moments. A much larger class of problems, such as genetic networks and cascades, also remain exactly solvable with this approximation.

title = {Sequence context affects the rate of short insertions and deletions in flies and primates},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Insertions and deletions (indels) are an important evolutionary force, making the evolutionary process more efficient and flexible by copying and removing genomic fragments of various lengths instead of rediscovering them by point mutations. As a mutational process, indels are known to be more active in specific sequences (like micro-satellites) but not much is known about the more general and mechanistic effect of sequence context on the insertion and deletion susceptibility of genomic loci. RESULTS: Here we analyze a large collection of high confidence short insertions and deletions in primates and flies, revealing extensive correlations between sequence context and indel rates and building principled models for predicting these rates from sequence. According to our results, the rate of insertion or deletion of specific lengths can vary by more than 100-fold, depending on the surrounding sequence. These mutational biases can strongly influence the composition of the genome and the rate at which particular sequences appear. We exemplify this by showing how degenerate loci in human exons are selected to reduce their frame shifting indel propensity. CONCLUSION: Insertions and deletions are strongly affected by sequence context. Consequentially, genomes must adapt to significant variation in the mutational input at indel-prone and indel-immune loci.},

Analyses of semiannual blood samples obtained from six infected men showed that a rapid rate of CD4 T cell loss was associated with relative evolutionary stasis of the HIV-1 quasispecies virus population. More moderate rates of CD4 T cell loss correlated with genetic evolution within three of four subjects. Consistent with selection by the immune constraints of these subjects, amino acid changes were apparent within the appropriate epitopes of human leukocyte antigen class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Thus, the evolutionary dynamics exhibited by the HIV-1 quasispecies virus populations under natural selection are compatible with adaptive evolution.},

title = {Statistical epistasis is a generic feature of gene regulatory networks},
abstract = {Functional dependencies between genes are a defining characteristic of gene networks underlying quantitative traits. However, recent studies show that the proportion of the genetic variation that can be attributed to statistical epistasis varies from almost zero to very high. It is thus of fundamental as well as instrumental importance to better understand whether different functional dependency patterns among polymorphic genes give rise to distinct statistical interaction patterns or not. Here we address this issue by combining a quantitative genetic model approach with genotype-phenotype models capable of translating allelic variation and regulatory principles into phenotypic variation at the level of gene expression. We show that gene regulatory networks with and without feedback motifs can exhibit a wide range of possible statistical genetic architectures with regard to both type of effect explaining phenotypic variance and number of apparent loci underlying the observed phenotypic effect. Although all motifs are capable of harboring significant interactions, positive feedback gives rise to higher amounts and more types of statistical epistasis. The results also suggest that the inclusion of statistical interaction terms in genetic models will increase the chance to detect additional QTL as well as functional dependencies between genetic loci over a broad range of regulatory regimes. This article illustrates how statistical genetic methods can fruitfully be combined with nonlinear systems dynamics to elucidate biological issues beyond reach of each methodology in isolation.},

abstract = {The fine-scale distribution of meiotic recombination events in the human genome can be inferred from patterns of haplotype diversity in human populations but directly studied only by high-resolution sperm typing. Both approaches indicate that crossovers are heavily clustered into narrow recombination hot spots. But our direct understanding of hot-spot properties and distributions is largely limited to sperm typing in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). We now describe the analysis of an unremarkable 206-kb region on human chromosome 1, which identified localized regions of linkage disequilibrium breakdown that mark the locations of sperm crossover hot spots. The distribution, intensity and morphology of these hot spots are markedly similar to those in the MHC. But we also accidentally detected additional hot spots in regions of strong association. Coalescent analysis of genotype data detected most of the hot spots but showed significant differences between sperm crossover frequencies and historical recombination rates. This raises the possibility that some hot spots, particularly those in regions of strong association, may have evolved very recently and not left their full imprint on haplotype diversity. These results suggest that hot spots could be very abundant and possibly fluid features of the human genome.},

title = {Evolution of recombination due to random drift},
abstract = {In finite populations subject to selection, genetic drift generates negative linkage disequilibrium, on average, even if selection acts independently (i.e., multiplicatively) upon all loci. Negative disequilibrium reduces the variance in fitness and hence, by Fisher's (1930) fundamental theorem, slows the rate of increase in mean fitness. Modifiers that increase recombination eliminate the negative disequilibria that impede selection and consequently increase in frequency by "hitchhiking." Thus, stochastic fluctuations in linkage disequilibrium in finite populations favor the evolution of increased rates of recombination, even in the absence of epistatic interactions among loci and even when disequilibrium is initially absent. The method developed within this article allows us to quantify the strength of selection acting on a modifier allele that increases recombination in a finite population. The analysis indicates that stochastically generated linkage disequilibria do select for increased recombination, a result that is confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations. Selection for a modifier that increases recombination is highest when linkage among loci is tight, when beneficial alleles rise from low to high frequency, and when the population size is small.},

abstract = {Is a group best off if everyone co-operates? Theory often considers this to be so (e.g. the "conspiracy of doves"), this understanding underpinning social and economic policy. We observe, however, that after competition between "cheat" and "co-operator" strains of yeast, population fitness is maximized under co-existence. To address whether this might just be a peculiarity of our experimental system or a result with broader applicability, we assemble, benchmark, dissect, and test a systems model. This reveals the conditions necessary to recover the unexpected result. These are 3-fold: (a) that resources are used inefficiently when they are abundant, (b) that the amount of co-operation needed cannot be accurately assessed, and (c) the population is structured, such that co-operators receive more of the resource than the cheats. Relaxing any of the assumptions can lead to population fitness being maximized when cheats are absent, which we experimentally demonstrate. These three conditions will often be relevant, and hence in order to understand the trajectory of social interactions, understanding the dynamics of the efficiency of resource utilization and accuracy of information will be necessary.},

abstract = {The reproducibility and precision of biological patterning is limited by the accuracy with which concentration profiles of morphogen molecules can be established and read out by their targets. We consider four measures of precision for the Bicoid morphogen in the Drosophila embryo: the concentration differences that distinguish neighboring cells, the limits set by the random arrival of Bicoid molecules at their targets (which depends on absolute concentration), the noise in readout of Bicoid by the activation of Hunchback, and the reproducibility of Bicoid concentration at corresponding positions in multiple embryos. We show, through a combination of different experiments, that all of these quantities are approximately 10%. This agreement among different measures of accuracy indicates that the embryo is not faced with noisy input signals and readout mechanisms; rather, the system exerts precise control over absolute concentrations and responds reliably to small concentration differences, approaching the limits set by basic physical principles.},

title = {Sequence features in regions of weak and strong linkage disequilibrium},
abstract = {We use genotype data generated by the International HapMap Project to dissect the relationship between sequence features and the degree of linkage disequilibrium in the genome. We show that variation in linkage disequilibrium is broadly similar across populations and examine sequence landscape in regions of strong and weak disequilibrium. Linkage disequilibrium is generally low within approximately 15 Mb of the telomeres of each chromosome and noticeably elevated in large, duplicated regions of the genome as well as within approximately 5 Mb of centromeres and other heterochromatic regions. At a broad scale (100-1000 kb resolution), our results show that regions of strong linkage disequilibrium are typically GC poor and have reduced polymorphism. In addition, these regions are enriched for LINE repeats, but have fewer SINE, DNA, and simple repeats than the rest of the genome. At a fine scale, we examine the sequence composition of "hotspots" for the rapid breakdown of linkage disequilibrium and show that they are enriched in SINEs, in simple repeats, and in sequences that are conserved between species. Regions of high and low linkage disequilibrium (the top and bottom quartiles of the genome) have a higher density of genes and coding bases than the rest of the genome. Closer examination of the data shows that whereas some types of genes (including genes involved in immune response and sensory perception) are typically located in regions of low linkage disequilibrium, other genes (including those involved in DNA and RNA metabolism, response to DNA damage, and the cell cycle) are preferentially located in regions of strong linkage disequilibrium. Our results provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between sequence features and linkage disequilibrium and suggest an evolutionary justification for the heterogeneity in linkage disequilibrium in the genome.},

We find that a cost function that determines a Boltzmann-like stationary distribution can always be defined near it. Such a stationary distribution does not need to satisfy the usual detailed balance condition but might have instead a divergence-free probability current. In the linear case, the force can be split into two parts, one of which gives detailed balance with the diffusive motion, whereas the other induces cyclic motion on surfaces of constant cost function. By using the Jordan transformation for the force matrix, we find an explicit construction of the cost function. We discuss singularities of the transformation and their consequences for the stationary distribution. This Boltzmann-like distribution may be not unique, and nonlinear effects and boundary conditions may change the distribution and induce additional currents even in the neighborhood of a fixed point.},

title = {Environmental stresses can alleviate the average deleterious effect of mutations},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fundamental questions in evolutionary genetics, including the possible advantage of sexual reproduction, depend critically on the effects of deleterious mutations on fitness. Limited existing experimental evidence suggests that, on average, such effects tend to be aggravated under environmental stresses, consistent with the perception that stress diminishes the organism's ability to tolerate deleterious mutations. Here, we ask whether there are also stresses with the opposite influence, under which the organism becomes more tolerant to mutations. RESULTS: We developed a technique, based on bioluminescence, which allows accurate automated measurements of bacterial growth rates at very low cell densities. Using this system, we measured growth rates of Escherichia coli mutants under a diverse set of environmental stresses. In contrast to the perception that stress always reduces the organism's ability to tolerate mutations, our measurements identified stresses that do the opposite - that is, despite decreasing wild-type growth, they alleviate, on average, the effect of deleterious mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a qualitative difference between various environmental stresses ranging from alleviation to aggravation of the average effect of mutations. We further show how the existence of stresses that are biased towards alleviation of the effects of mutations may imply the existence of average epistatic interactions between mutations. The results thus offer a connection between the two main factors controlling the effects of deleterious mutations: environmental conditions and epistatic interactions.},

title = {Dynamics of genetic variability in two-locus models of stabilizing selection},
abstract = {We study a two locus model, with additive contributions to the phenotype, to explore the dynamics of different phenotypic characteristics under stabilizing selection and recombination. We demonstrate that the interaction of selection and recombination results in constraints on the mode of phenotypic evolution. Let Vg be the genic variance of the trait and CL be the contribution of linkage disequilibrium to the genotypic variance. We demonstrate that, independent of the initial conditions, the dynamics of the system on the plane (Vg, CL) are typically characterized by a quick approach to a straight line with slow evolution along this line afterward. We analyze how the mode and the rate of phenotypic evolution depend on the strength of selection relative to recombination, on the form of fitness function, and the difference in allelic effect. We argue that if selection is not extremely weak relative to recombination, linkage disequilibrium generated by stabilizing selection influences the dynamics significantly. We demonstrate that under these conditions, which are plausible in nature and certainly the case in artificial stabilizing selection experiments, the model can have a polymorphic equilibrium with positive linkage disequilibrium that is stable simultaneously with monomorphic equilibria.},

title = {The role of recombination in the emergence of a complex and dynamic {HIV} epidemic},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inter-subtype recombinants dominate the HIV epidemics in three geographical regions. To better understand the role of HIV recombinants in shaping the current HIV epidemic, we here present the results of a large-scale subtyping analysis of 9435 HIV-1 sequences that involve subtypes A, B, C, G, F and the epidemiologically important recombinants derived from three continents. RESULTS: The circulating recombinant form CRF02_AG, common in West Central Africa, appears to result from recombination events that occurred early in the divergence between subtypes A and G, followed by additional recent recombination events that contribute to the breakpoint pattern defining the current recombinant lineage. This finding also corrects a recent claim that G is a recombinant and a descendant of CRF02, which was suggested to be a pure subtype. The BC and BF recombinants in China and South America, respectively, are derived from recent recombination between contemporary parental lineages. Shared breakpoints in South America BF recombinants indicate that the HIV-1 epidemics in Argentina and Brazil are not independent. Therefore, the contemporary HIV-1 epidemic has recombinant lineages of both ancient and more recent origins. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, we show that these recombinant lineages, which are highly prevalent in the current HIV epidemic, are a mixture of ancient and recent recombination. The HIV pandemic is moving towards having increasing complexity and higher prevalence of recombinant forms, sometimes existing as "families" of related forms. We find that the classification of some CRF designations need to be revised as a consequence of (1) an estimated > 5% error in the original subtype assignments deposited in the Los Alamos sequence database; (2) an increasing number of CRFs are defined while they do not readily fit into groupings for molecular epidemiology and vaccine design; and (3) a dynamic HIV epidemic context.},

title = {High rates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 recombination: near-random segregation of markers one kilobase apart in one round of viral replication},
abstract = {One of the genetic consequences of packaging two copies of full-length viral RNA into a single retroviral virion is frequent recombination during reverse transcription. Many of the currently circulating strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are recombinants. Recombination can also accelerate the generation of multidrug-resistant HIV-1 and therefore presents challenges to effective antiviral therapy. In this study, we determined that HIV-1 recombination rates with markers 1.0, 1.3, and 1.9 kb apart were 42.4, 50.4, and 47.4% in one round of viral replication. Because the predicted recombination rate of two unlinked markers is 50%, we conclude that markers 1 kb apart segregated in a manner similar to that for two unlinked markers in one round of retroviral replication. These recombination rates are exceedingly high even among retroviruses. Recombination rates of markers separated by 1 kb are 4 and 4.7% in one round of spleen necrosis virus and murine leukemia virus replication, respectively. Therefore, HIV-1 recombination can be 10-fold higher than that of other retroviruses. Recombination can be observed only in the proviruses derived from heterozygous virions that contain two genotypically different RNAs. The high rates of HIV-1 recombination observed in our studies also indicate that heterozygous virions are formed efficiently during HIV-1 replication and most HIV-1 virions are capable of undergoing recombination. Our results demonstrate that recombination is an effective mechanism to break the genetic linkage between neighboring sequences, thereby reassorting the HIV-1 genome and increasing the diversity in the viral population.},

abstract = {Despite limited data supporting the superiority of dominant over subdominant responses, immunodominant epitopes represent the preferred vaccine candidates. To address the function of subdominant responses in human immunodeficiency virus infection, we analyzed cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses restricted by HLA-B*1503, a rare allele in a cohort infected with clade B, although common in one infected with clade C. HLA-B*1503 was associated with reduced viral loads in the clade B cohort but not the clade C cohort, although both shared the immunodominant response. Clade B viral control was associated with responses to several subdominant cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes, whereas their clade C variants were less well recognized. These data suggest that subdominant responses can contribute to in vivo viral control and that high HLA allele frequencies may drive the elimination of subdominant yet effective epitopes from circulating viral populations.},

title = {Natural hybridization generates mammalian lineage with species characteristics},
abstract = {Most diploid species arise from single-species ancestors. Hybrid origins of new species are uncommon (except among polyploids) and are documented infrequently in animals. Examples of natural hybridization leading to speciation in mammals are exceedingly rare. Here, we show a Caribbean species of bat (Artibeus schwartzi) has a nuclear genome derived from two nonsister but congeneric species (A. jamaicensis and A. planirostris) and a mitochondrial genome that is from a third extinct or uncharacterized congener. Artibeus schwartzi is self-sustaining, morphologically distinct, and exists in near geographic isolation of its known parent species. Island effects (i.e., area, reduced habitat variability, and geographic isolation) likely have restricted gene flow from parental species into the Caribbean populations of this hybrid lineage, thus contributing to local adaptation and isolation of this newly produced taxon. We hypothesize differential rates of the development of reproductive isolation within the genus and estimate that 2.5 million years was an insufficient amount of time for the development of postzygotic isolation among the three species that hybridized to produce A. schwartzi. Reticulated evolution thus has resulted in a genomic combination from three evolutionary lineages and a transgressive phenotype that is distinct from all other known species of Artibeus. The data herein further demonstrate the phenomenon of speciation by hybridization in mammals is possible in nature.},

title = {Relaxed phylogenetics and dating with confidence},
abstract = {In phylogenetics, the unrooted model of phylogeny and the strict molecular clock model are two extremes of a continuum. Despite their dominance in phylogenetic inference, it is evident that both are biologically unrealistic and that the real evolutionary process lies between these two extremes. Fortunately, intermediate models employing relaxed molecular clocks have been described. These models open the gate to a new field of "relaxed phylogenetics." Here we introduce a new approach to performing relaxed phylogenetic analysis. We describe how it can be used to estimate phylogenies and divergence times in the face of uncertainty in evolutionary rates and calibration times. Our approach also provides a means for measuring the clocklikeness of datasets and comparing this measure between different genes and phylogenies. We find no significant rate autocorrelation among branches in three large datasets, suggesting that autocorrelated models are not necessarily suitable for these data. In addition, we place these datasets on the continuum of clocklikeness between a strict molecular clock and the alternative unrooted extreme. Finally, we present analyses of 102 bacterial, 106 yeast, 61 plant, 99 metazoan, and 500 primate alignments. From these we conclude that our method is phylogenetically more accurate and precise than the traditional unrooted model while adding the ability to infer a timescale to evolution.},

title = {Bottleneck effect on genetic variance. A theoretical investigation of the role of dominance},
abstract = {The phenomenon that the genetic variance of fitness components increase following a bottleneck or inbreeding is supported by a growing number of experiments and is explained theoretically by either dominance or epistasis. In this article, diffusion approximations under the infinite sites model are used to quantify the effect of dominance, using data on viability in Drosophila melanogaster. The model is based on mutation parameters from mutation accumulation experiments involving balancer chromosomes (set I) or inbred lines (set II). In essence, set I assumes many mutations of small effect, whereas set II assumes fewer mutations of large effect. Compared to empirical estimates from large outbred populations, set I predicts reasonable genetic variances but too low mean viability. In contrast, set II predicts a reasonable mean viability but a low genetic variance. Both sets of parameters predict the changes in mean viability (depression), additive variance, between-line variance and heritability following bottlenecks generally compatible with empirical results, and these changes are mainly caused by lethals and deleterious mutants of large effect. This article suggests that dominance is the main cause for increased genetic variances for fitness components and fitness-related traits after bottlenecks observed in various experiments.},

The widespread reliance on computational procedures that are devoid of population-genetic details to generate hypotheses for the evolution of network configurations seems to be unjustified.},

Therefore, a more integrative biology approach is needed to unravel the complexity and causes of such diseases. To elucidate the complexity of common human diseases such as obesity, we have analysed the expression of 23,720 transcripts in large population-based blood and adipose tissue cohorts comprehensively assessed for various phenotypes, including traits related to clinical obesity. In contrast to the blood expression profiles, we observed a marked correlation between gene expression in adipose tissue and obesity-related traits. Genome-wide linkage and association mapping revealed a highly significant genetic component to gene expression traits, including a strong genetic effect of proximal (cis) signals, with 50% of the cis signals overlapping between the two tissues profiled. Here we demonstrate an extensive transcriptional network constructed from the human adipose data that exhibits significant overlap with similar network modules constructed from mouse adipose data. A core network module in humans and mice was identified that is enriched for genes involved in the inflammatory and immune response and has been found to be causally associated to obesity-related traits.},

The H2 lineage is rare in Africans, almost absent in East Asians but found at a frequency of 20% in Europeans, in whom the haplotype structure is indicative of a history of positive selection. Here we show that the H2 lineage is undergoing positive selection in the Icelandic population, such that carrier females have more children and have higher recombination rates than noncarriers.},

abstract = {Responsible for the majority of bacterial gastroenteritis in the developed world, Campylobacter jejuni is a pervasive pathogen of humans and animals, but its evolution is obscure. In this paper, we exploit contemporary genetic diversity and empirical evidence to piece together the evolutionary history of C. jejuni and quantify its evolutionary potential. Our combined population genetics-phylogenetics approach reveals a surprising picture. Campylobacter jejuni is a rapidly evolving species, subject to intense purifying selection that purges 60% of novel variation, but possessing a massive evolutionary potential. The low mutation rate is offset by a large effective population size so that a mutation at any site can occur somewhere in the population within the space of a week. Recombination has a fundamental role, generating diversity at twice the rate of de novo mutation, and facilitating gene flow between C. jejuni and its sister species Campylobacter coli. We attempt to calibrate the rate of molecular evolution in C. jejuni based solely on within-species variation. The rates we obtain are up to 1,000 times faster than conventional estimates, placing the C. jejuni-C. coli split at the time of the Neolithic revolution. We weigh the plausibility of such recent bacterial evolution against alternative explanations and discuss the evidence required to settle the issue.},

abstract = {Despite tremendous progress in understanding the nature of the immune system, the full diversity of an organism's antibody repertoire is unknown. We used high-throughput sequencing of the variable domain of the antibody heavy chain from 14 zebrafish to analyze VDJ usage and antibody sequence. Zebrafish were found to use between 50 and 86% of all possible VDJ combinations and shared a similar frequency distribution, with some correlation of VDJ patterns between individuals. Zebrafish antibodies retained a few thousand unique heavy chains that also exhibited a shared frequency distribution. We found evidence of convergence, in which different individuals made the same antibody. This approach provides insight into the breadth of the expressed antibody repertoire and immunological diversity at the level of an individual organism.},

title = {Positive selection on MMP3 regulation has shaped heart disease risk},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The evolutionary forces of mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift shape the pattern of phenotypic variation in nature, but the roles of these forces in defining the distributions of particular traits have been hard to disentangle. To better understand the mechanisms contributing to common variation in humans, we investigated the evolutionary history of a functional polymorphism in the upstream regulatory region of the MMP3 gene. This single base pair insertion/deletion variant, which results in a run of either 5 or 6 thymidines 1608 bp from the transcription start site, alters transcription factor binding and influences levels of MMP3 mRNA and protein. The polymorphism contributes to variation in arterial traits and to the risk of coronary heart disease and its progression. RESULTS: Phylogenetic and population genetic analysis of primate sequences indicate that the binding site region is rapidly evolving and has been a hot spot for mutation for tens of millions of years. We also find evidence for the action of positive selection, beginning approximately 24,000 years ago, increasing the frequency of the high-expression allele in Europe but not elsewhere. Positive selection is evident in statistical tests of differentiation among populations and haplotype diversity within populations. Europeans have greater arterial elasticity and suffer dramatically fewer coronary heart disease events than they would have had this selection not occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Locally elevated mutation rates and strong positive selection on a cis-regulatory variant have shaped contemporary phenotypic variation and public health.},

By analyzing many cell and tissue types, we show that this approach reveals rules of hierarchical protein network organization, in which the frequency distribution of different protein clusters obeys Zipf's law, and state-specific lead proteins appear to control protein network topology and function.

title = {Diversity and complexity of {HIV}-1 drug resistance: a bioinformatics approach to predicting phenotype from genotype},
abstract = {Drug resistance testing has been shown to be beneficial for clinical management of HIV type 1 infected patients. Whereas phenotypic assays directly measure drug resistance, the commonly used genotypic assays provide only indirect evidence of drug resistance, the major challenge being the interpretation of the sequence information. We analyzed the significance of sequence variations in the protease and reverse transcriptase genes for drug resistance and derived models that predict phenotypic resistance from genotypes. For 14 antiretroviral drugs, both genotypic and phenotypic resistance data from 471 clinical isolates were analyzed with a machine learning approach. Information profiles were obtained that quantify the statistical significance of each sequence position for drug resistance. For the different drugs, patterns of varying complexity were observed, including between one and nine sequence positions with substantial information content. Based on these information profiles, decision tree classifiers were generated to identify genotypic patterns characteristic of resistance or susceptibility to the different drugs. We obtained concise and easily interpretable models to predict drug resistance from sequence information. The prediction quality of the models was assessed in leave-one-out experiments in terms of the prediction error. We found prediction errors of 9.6-15.5% for all drugs except for zalcitabine, didanosine, and stavudine, with prediction errors between 25.4% and 32.0%.

Thr population is infinite, and continuous variation of genotype is allowed. Nonetheless, Waxman and peck showed that if each gene affects three or more traits, then the steady-state solution of the model can have a nonzero traction of the population with identical alleles. We use a recursion technique to calculate the distribution of alleles at finite times as well as in the infinite-time limit, We map Waxman and Peck's model into the mean-field theory for Bose condensation, and a variant of the model onto a bound-state problem in quantum theory. These mappings aid in delineating the region of parameter space in which the unique genotype occurs. We also discuss our attempts to correlate the statistics of DNA-sequence variation with the degree of pleiotropy of various genes.},

abstract = {A population can adapt to a rapid environmental change or habitat expansion in two ways. It may adapt either through new beneficial mutations that subsequently sweep through the population or by using alleles from the standing genetic variation. We use diffusion theory to calculate the probabilities for selective adaptations and find a large increase in the fixation probability for weak substitutions, if alleles originate from the standing genetic variation. We then determine the parameter regions where each scenario--standing variation vs. new mutations--is more likely. Adaptations from the standing genetic variation are favored if either the selective advantage is weak or the selection coefficient and the mutation rate are both high. Finally, we analyze the probability of "soft sweeps," where multiple copies of the selected allele contribute to a substitution, and discuss the consequences for the footprint of selection on linked neutral variation. We find that soft sweeps with weaker selective footprints are likely under both scenarios if the mutation rate and/or the selection coefficient is high.},

abstract = {Recombination rate and linkage disequilibrium, the latter a function of population genomic processes, are the critical parameters for mapping by linkage and association, and their patterns in Caenorhabditis elegans are poorly understood. We performed high-density SNP genotyping on a large panel of recombinant inbred advanced intercross lines (RIAILs) of C. elegans to characterize the landscape of recombination and, on a panel of wild strains, to characterize population genomic patterns. We confirmed that C. elegans autosomes exhibit discrete domains of nearly constant recombination rate, and we show, for the first time, that the pattern holds for the X chromosome as well. The terminal domains of each chromosome, spanning about 7% of the genome, exhibit effectively no recombination. The RIAILs exhibit a 5.3-fold expansion of the genetic map. With median marker spacing of 61 kb, they are a powerful resource for mapping quantitative trait loci in C. elegans. Among 125 wild isolates, we identified only 41 distinct haplotypes. The patterns of genotypic similarity suggest that some presumed wild strains are laboratory contaminants. The Hawaiian strain, CB4856, exhibits genetic isolation from the remainder of the global population, whose members exhibit ample evidence of intercrossing and recombining. The population effective recombination rate, estimated from the pattern of linkage disequilibrium, is correlated with the estimated meiotic recombination rate, but its magnitude implies that the effective rate of outcrossing is extremely low, corroborating reports of selection against recombinant genotypes. Despite the low population, effective recombination rate and extensive linkage disequilibrium among chromosomes, which are techniques that account for background levels of genomic similarity, permit association mapping in wild C. elegans strains.},

title = {The evolutionary advantage of recombination},
abstract = {The controversy over the evolutionary advantage of recombination initially discovered by Fisher and by Muller is reviewed. Those authors whose models had finite-population effects found an advantage of recombination, and those whose models had infinite populations found none. The advantage of recombination is that it breaks down random linkage disequilibrium generated by genetic drift. Hill and Robertson found that the average effect of this randomly-generated linkage disequilibrium was to cause linked loci to interfere with each other's response to selection, even where there was no gene interaction between the loci. This effect is shown to be identical to the original argument of Fisher and Muller. It also predicts the "ratchet mechanism" discovered by Muller, who pointed out that deleterious mutants would more readily increase in a population without recombination. Computer simulations of substitution of favorable mutants and of the long-term increase of deleterious mutants verified the essential correctness of the original Fisher-Muller argument and the reality of the Muller ratchet mechanism. It is argued that these constitute an intrinsic advantage of recombination capable of accounting for its persistence in the face of selection for tighter linkage between interacting polymorphisms, and possibly capable of accounting for its origin.},

title = {The unit of selection in Drosophila mercatorum. I. The interation of selection and meiosis in parthenogenetic strains},
abstract = {An important problem in population genetics is the determination of the level of genetic organization to which fitness measures can be ascribed that yield an adequate description or prediction of the outcome of selection in populations. To study this problem, we used two strains of Drosophila merca torum (S-1-Im and O-3-Im) that are capable of both sexual and parthenogenetic reproduction, a feature that allows us to experimentally control many factors which affect genetic variability. Both S and O reproduce parthenogenetically by "pronuclear duplication," a mechanism that retains normal meiosis (and hence crossing over and assortment) but results in homozygosity for all loci in a single generation. Since an isozyme survey indicated that S and O differ at a third of their loci, we hypothesized that S and O have adapted in genetically distinct fashions to the genetic environment of total homozygosity. This is tested by breeding females that are S-O hybrids for 100%, 60% and 40% of their genetic backgrounds, and scoring their respective pathenogenetic progenies for four isozyme and two visible markers. The data collected gave evidence for a coadaptation to total homozygosity involving non-additive and non-multiplicative interactions between non-alleles. As the perturbation of the parental coadapted genotypes by meiosis increases (i.e., the greater the degree of S-O hybridity), the level of genetic material which behaves as an additive/multiplicative fitness unit becomes larger. Selective neutrality of genetic variation may be an artifact of our failure to measure the proper genetic unit of selection.},

abstract = {To determine the extent of homologous recombination in human influenza A virus, we assembled a data set of 13,852 sequences representing all eight segments and both major circulating subtypes, H3N2 and H1N1. Using an exhaustive search and a nonparametric test for mosaic structure, we identified 315 sequences (approximately 2%) in five different RNA segments that, after a multiple-comparison correction, had statistically significant mosaic signals compatible with homologous recombination. Of these, only two contained recombinant regions of sufficient length (>100 nucleotides [nt]) that the occurrence of homologous recombination could be verified using phylogenetic methods, with the rest involving very short sequence regions (15 to 30 nt). Although this secondary analysis revealed patterns of phylogenetic incongruence compatible with the action of recombination, neither candidate recombinant was strongly supported. Given our inability to exclude the occurrence of mixed infection and template switching during amplification, laboratory artifacts provide an alternative and likely explanation for the occurrence of phylogenetic incongruence in these two cases. We therefore conclude that, if it occurs at all, homologous recombination plays only a very minor role in the evolution of human influenza A virus.},

They are encoded in a short genomic interval, and overall activity may result from interplay between allelic variants at each locus. With multiethnic DNA panels that represent a wide spectrum of human populations, we demonstrate long-range linkage disequilibrium among the three genes. A large fraction of the variation found in the locus can be explained by the presence of extended haplotypes encompassing variants at CD28, CTLA4, and the ICOS promoter. There are unusual differences in the distribution of some variants and haplotypes between geographic regions. The differences may reflect demographic events and/or the adaptation to diverse environmental and microbial challenges encountered in the course of human migrations and will be important to consider when interpreting association to immune/autoimmune responsiveness.},

abstract = {The diploid nature of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) indicates that recombination serves a central function in virus replication and evolution. Previously, while examining the nature of obligatory primer strand transfers during reverse transcription, a high rate of recombination was observed at the ends of the viral genome within the viral long terminal repeats, prompting the following question: does recombination occur at a high rate throughout the genome? To address this question, two vectors based upon different strains of HIV-1 were utilized. The vectors were comprised predominantly of autologous HIV-1 sequence and were approximately the same size as the parental genome. The proviral progeny of heterodimeric virions were analyzed after a single cycle of replication, and the sequence heterogeneity between the two strains allowed direct examination of recombination crossovers. The results obtained indicate that HIV-1 undergoes approximately two to three recombination events per genome per replication cycle. These results imply that both HIV-1 RNAs are typically utilized during reverse transcription and that recombination is an important aspect of HIV-1 replication.},

title = {Pervasive hitchhiking at coding and regulatory sites in humans},
abstract = {Much effort and interest have focused on assessing the importance of natural selection, particularly positive natural selection, in shaping the human genome. Although scans for positive selection have identified candidate loci that may be associated with positive selection in humans, such scans do not indicate whether adaptation is frequent in general in humans. Studies based on the reasoning of the MacDonald-Kreitman test, which, in principle, can be used to evaluate the extent of positive selection, suggested that adaptation is detectable in the human genome but that it is less common than in Drosophila or Escherichia coli. Both positive and purifying natural selection at functional sites should affect levels and patterns of polymorphism at linked nonfunctional sites. Here, we search for these effects by analyzing patterns of neutral polymorphism in humans in relation to the rates of recombination, functional density, and functional divergence with chimpanzees. We find that the levels of neutral polymorphism are lower in the regions of lower recombination and in the regions of higher functional density or divergence. These correlations persist after controlling for the variation in GC content, density of simple repeats, selective constraint, mutation rate, and depth of sequencing coverage. We argue that these results are most plausibly explained by the effects of natural selection at functional sites -- either recurrent selective sweeps or background selection -- on the levels of linked neutral polymorphism. Natural selection at both coding and regulatory sites appears to affect linked neutral polymorphism, reducing neutral polymorphism by 6% genome-wide and by 11% in the gene-rich half of the human genome. These findings suggest that the effects of natural selection at linked sites cannot be ignored in the study of neutral human polymorphism.},

abstract = {The theory of evolution at a selectively neutral locus that controls the recombination between two major loci that are under selection is studied. If the major loci are at a stable equilibrium in linkage disequilibrium under selection and recombination, then a mutation at the modifier locus will increase in frequency when rare if and only if it decreases the recombination fraction. If the major loci are in disequilibrium at a balance between selection against deleterious alleles and mutation towards them, then two new phenomena are observed. First, a recombination increasing mutation will succeed if the disequilibrium is negative and the modifier is sufficiently tightly linked to the major loci. Second, depending on the strength of selection, even if the disequilibrium is negative, recombination reduction may occur for looser linkage between the major and modifier loci.},

abstract = {The handicap principle holds that costly sexual signals can reliably indicate mate quality. Only individuals of high quality can afford a strong signal-the cost of signaling is relatively lower for high-quality signalers than for low-quality signalers. This critical property is difficult to test experimentally because the benefit of signaling on mating success, and cost of signaling on other components of fitness, cannot easily be separated in obligate sexual organisms. We therefore studied the facultatively sexual yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which produces pheromones to attract potential mates. To precisely measure the cost of signaling, the signal was reduced or removed by deleting one or both copies of the pheromone-encoding genes and measuring asexual growth rate in competition with a wild-type signaler. We manipulated signaler quality either by changing the quality of the assay environment or by changing the number of deleterious mutations carried. For both types of treatment, we found that the cost of signaling decreased as the quality of the signaler increased, demonstrating that the yeast pheromone signal has the key property required for selection under the handicap principle. We found that cells of high genetic quality produce stronger signals than low-quality cells, verifying that the signal is indeed honest.},

In this work we derive and analyze a mathematically tractable model of the genotype-phenotype map that allows for any order of gene interaction. By assuming that the alterations of the effect of a gene substitution due to changes in the genetic background can be described as a linear transformation, we show that the genotype-phenotype map is a sum of linear and multilinear terms of operationally defined "reference" effects at each locus. The "multilinear" model is used to study the effect of epistasis on quantitative genetic variation, on the response to selection, and on genetic canalization. It is shown how the model can be used to estimate the strength of "functional" epistasis from a variety of genetic experiments.},

However, these patterns have no compelling explanation, and some of the observations even appear to be mutually incompatible. We review and extend a major class of theoretical models, 'mutation-selection models', that have been proposed to explain quantitative genetic variation. We also briefly review an alternative class of 'balancing selection models'. We consider to what extent the models are compatible with the general observations, and argue that a key issue is understanding and modelling pleiotropy. We discuss some of the thorny issues that arise when formulating models that describe many traits simultaneously.},

If rates of deleterious mutation per diploid genome per generation (U) exceed 1, and mutations interact synergistically, then sexuals can overcome their inherent twofold disadvantage. We have tested this hypothesis by estimating genomic point mutation rates for protein-coding genes in a range of animal taxa. We find a positive linear relationship between U and generation time. In species with short generation times, U is predicted to be far below 1, suggesting that sex is not maintained by its capacity to purge the genome of deleterious mutations.},

abstract = {The population structure of an organism reflects its evolutionary history and influences its evolutionary trajectory. It constrains the combination of genetic diversity and reveals patterns of past gene flow. Understanding it is a prerequisite for detecting genomic regions under selection, predicting the effect of population disturbances, or modeling gene flow. This paper examines the detailed global population structure of Arabidopsis thaliana. Using a set of 5,707 plants collected from around the globe and genotyped at 149 SNPs, we show that while A. thaliana as a species self-fertilizes 97% of the time, there is considerable variation among local groups. This level of outcrossing greatly limits observed heterozygosity but is sufficient to generate considerable local haplotypic diversity. We also find that in its native Eurasian range A. thaliana exhibits continuous isolation by distance at every geographic scale without natural breaks corresponding to classical notions of populations. By contrast, in North America, where it exists as an exotic species, A. thaliana exhibits little or no population structure at a continental scale but local isolation by distance that extends hundreds of km. This suggests a pattern for the development of isolation by distance that can establish itself shortly after an organism fills a new habitat range. It also raises questions about the general applicability of many standard population genetics models. Any model based on discrete clusters of interchangeable individuals will be an uneasy fit to organisms like A. thaliana which exhibit continuous isolation by distance on many scales.},

By probabilistically modeling mutations in the HIV-1 protease or reverse transcriptase (RT) isolated from drug-treated patients, we present a statistical procedure that first detects mutation combinations associated with drug resistance and then infers detailed interaction structures of these mutations. The molecular basis of our statistical predictions is further studied by using molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations. We have demonstrated the usefulness of this systematic procedure on three HIV drugs, (Indinavir, Zidovudine, and Nevirapine), discovered unique interaction features between viral mutations induced by these drugs, and revealed the structural basis of such interactions.},

Here I calculate the rate at which fitness increases during adaptation and describe the curve giving fitness versus time as a population approaches an optimum in Fisher's model of adaptation. The results identify several factors affecting the speed of adaptation. One of the most important is organismal complexity--complex organisms adapt more slowly than simple ones when using mutations of the same phenotypic size. Thus, as Fisher foresaw, organisms pay a kind of cost of complexity. However, the magnitude of this cost is considerably larger than Fisher's analysis suggested. Indeed the rate of adaptation declines at least as fast as n-1, where n is the number of independent characters or dimensions comprising an organism. The present results also suggest that one can define an effective number of dimensions characterizing an adapting species.},

abstract = {To determine whether the distinctive features of Caenorhabditis elegans chromosomal organization are shared with the C. briggsae genome, we constructed a single nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic map to order and orient the whole genome shotgun assembly along the six C. briggsae chromosomes. Although these species are of the same genus, their most recent common ancestor existed 80-110 million years ago, and thus they are more evolutionarily distant than, for example, human and mouse. We found that, like C. elegans chromosomes, C. briggsae chromosomes exhibit high levels of recombination on the arms along with higher repeat density, a higher fraction of intronic sequence, and a lower fraction of exonic sequence compared with chromosome centers. Despite extensive intrachromosomal rearrangements, 1:1 orthologs tend to remain in the same region of the chromosome, and colinear blocks of orthologs tend to be longer in chromosome centers compared with arms. More strikingly, the two species show an almost complete conservation of synteny, with 1:1 orthologs present on a single chromosome in one species also found on a single chromosome in the other. The conservation of both chromosomal organization and synteny between these two distantly related species suggests roles for chromosome organization in the fitness of an organism that are only poorly understood presently.},

abstract = {Transcriptional modules of coregulated genes play a key role in regulatory networks. Comparative studies show that modules of coexpressed genes are conserved across taxa. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the evolution of module regulation. Here, we explore the evolution of cis-regulatory programs associated with conserved modules by integrating expression profiles for two yeast species and sequence data for a total of 17 fungal genomes. We show that although the cis-elements accompanying certain conserved modules are strictly conserved, those of other conserved modules are remarkably diverged. In particular, we infer the evolutionary history of the regulatory program governing ribosomal modules. We show how a cis-element emerged concurrently in dozens of promoters of ribosomal protein genes, followed by the loss of a more ancient cis-element. We suggest that this formation of an intermediate redundant regulatory program allows conserved transcriptional modules to gradually switch from one regulatory mechanism to another while maintaining their functionality. Our work provides a general framework for the study of the dynamics of promoter evolution at the level of transcriptional modules and may help in understanding the evolvability and increased redundancy of transcriptional regulation in higher organisms.},

title = {Effects of intersegmental transfers on target location by proteins},
abstract = { We study a model for a protein searching for a target, using facilitated diffusion, on a DNA molecule confined in a finite volume. The model includes three distinct pathways for facilitated diffusion: (a) sliding - in which the protein diffuses along the contour of the DNA (b) jumping - where the protein travels between two sites along the DNA by three-dimensional diffusion, and finally (c) intersegmental transfer - which allows the protein to move from one site to another by transiently binding both at the same time. The typical search time is calculated using scaling arguments which are verified numerically. Our results suggest that the inclusion of intersegmental transfer (i) decreases the search time considerably (ii) makes the search time much more robust to variations in the parameters of the model and (iii) that the optimal search time occurs in a regime very different than that found for models which ignore intersegmental transfers. The behavior we find is rich and shows surprising dependencies, for example, on the DNA length. },

We find that a low rate of environmental change can produce a very large increase in genetic variability. This may help to explain the high levels of heritability observed in many natural populations. We also study asexuality and find that a modest rate of environmental change can be very damaging to an asexual population, while leaving a sexual population virtually unscathed. Furthermore, in a changing environment, the advantages of sexuality over asexuality can be much greater than suggested by most previous studies. Our analysis applies in the case of very large populations, where stochastic forces may be neglected.},

abstract = {A molecular mapping experiment shows that a major gene effect on a quantitative trait, the level of alcohol dehydrogenase expression in Drosophila melanogaster, is due to multiple polymorphisms within the Adh gene. These polymorphisms are located in an intron, the coding sequence, and the 3' untranslated region. Because of nonrandom associations among polymorphisms at different sites, the individual effects combine (in some cases epistatically) to produce "superalleles" with large effect. These results have implications for the interpretation of major gene effects detected by quantitative trait locus mapping methods. They show that large effects due to a single locus may be due to multiple associated polymorphisms (or sequential fixations in isolated populations) rather than individual mutations of large effect.},

abstract = {Modularity and epistasis, as well as other aspects of genetic architecture, have emerged as central themes in evolutionary biology. Theory suggests that modularity promotes evolvability, and that aggravating (synergistic) epistasis among deleterious mutations facilitates the evolution of sex. Here, by contrast, we investigate the evolution of different genetic architectures using digital organisms, which are computer programs that self-replicate, mutate, compete and evolve. Specifically, we investigate how genetic architecture is shaped by reproductive mode. We allowed 200 populations of digital organisms to evolve for over 10 000 generations while reproducing either asexually or sexually. For 10 randomly chosen organisms from each population, we constructed and analysed all possible single mutants as well as one million mutants at each mutational distance from 2 to 10. The genomes of sexual organisms were more modular than asexual ones; sites encoding different functional traits had less overlap and sites encoding a particular trait were more tightly clustered. Net directional epistasis was alleviating (antagonistic) in both groups, although the overall strength of this epistasis was weaker in sexual than in asexual organisms. Our results show that sexual reproduction profoundly influences the evolution of the genetic architecture.},

title = {Genomic gene clustering analysis of pathways in eukaryotes},
abstract = {Genomic clustering of genes in a pathway is commonly found in prokaryotes due to transcriptional operons, but these are not present in most eukaryotes. Yet, there might be clustering to a lesser extent of pathway members in eukaryotic genomes, that assist coregulation of a set of functionally cooperating genes. We analyzed five sequenced eukaryotic genomes for clustering of genes assigned to the same pathway in the KEGG database. Between 98% and 30% of the analyzed pathways in a genome were found to exhibit significantly higher clustering levels than expected by chance. In descending order by the level of clustering, the genomes studied were Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Homo sapiens, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Drosophila melanogaster. Surprisingly, there is not much agreement between genomes in terms of which pathways are most clustered. Only seven of 69 pathways found in all species were significantly clustered in all five of them. This species-specific pattern of pathway clustering may reflect adaptations or evolutionary events unique to a particular lineage. We note that although operons are common in C. elegans, only 58% of the pathways showed significant clustering, which is less than in human. Virtually all pathways in S. cerevisiae showed significant clustering.},

title = {Maximum entropy models for antibody diversity},
abstract = { Recognition of pathogens relies on families of proteins showing great diversity. Here we construct maximum entropy models of the sequence repertoire, building on recent experiments that provide a nearly exhaustive sampling of the IgM sequences in zebrafish. These models are based solely on pairwise correlations between residue positions, but correctly capture the higher order statistical properties of the repertoire. Exploiting the interpretation of these models as statistical physics problems, we make several predictions for the collective properties of the sequence ensemble: the distribution of sequences obeys Zipf's law, the repertoire decomposes into several clusters, and there is a massive restriction of diversity due to the correlations. These predictions are completely inconsistent with models in which amino acid substitutions are made independently at each site, and are in good agreement with the data. Our results suggest that antibody diversity is not limited by the sequences encoded in the genome, and may reflect rapid adaptation to antigenic challenges. This approach should be applicable to the study of the global properties of other protein families. },

title = {Profiling the T-cell receptor beta-chain repertoire by massively parallel sequencing},
abstract = {T-cell receptor (TCR) genomic loci undergo somatic V(D)J recombination, plus the addition/subtraction of nontemplated bases at recombination junctions, in order to generate the repertoire of structurally diverse T cells necessary for antigen recognition. TCR beta subunits can be unambiguously identified by their hypervariable CDR3 (Complement Determining Region 3) sequence. This is the site of V(D)J recombination encoding the principal site of antigen contact. The complexity and dynamics of the T-cell repertoire remain unknown because the potential repertoire size has made conventional sequence analysis intractable. Here, we use 5'-RACE, Illumina sequencing, and a novel short read assembly strategy to sample CDR3(beta) diversity in human T lymphocytes from peripheral blood. Assembly of 40.5 million short reads identified 33,664 distinct TCR(beta) clonotypes and provides precise measurements of CDR3(beta) length diversity, usage of nontemplated bases, sequence convergence, and preferences for TRBV (T-cell receptor beta variable gene) and TRBJ (T-cell receptor beta joining gene) gene usage and pairing. CDR3 length between conserved residues of TRBV and TRBJ ranged from 21 to 81 nucleotides (nt). TRBV gene usage ranged from 0.01% for TRBV17 to 24.6% for TRBV20-1. TRBJ gene usage ranged from 1.6% for TRBJ2-6 to 17.2% for TRBJ2-1. We identified 1573 examples of convergence where the same amino acid translation was specified by distinct CDR3(beta) nucleotide sequences. Direct sequence-based immunoprofiling will likely prove to be a useful tool for understanding repertoire dynamics in response to immune challenge, without a priori knowledge of antigen.},

abstract = {The directional movement on a microtubule of a plastic bead connected elastically to a single one-headed kinesin motor is studied theoretically. The kinesin motor can bind and unbind to periodic binding sites on the microtubule and undergo conformational changes while catalyzing the hydrolysis of ATP. An analytic formalism relating the dynamics of the bead and the ATP hydrolysis cycle of the motor is derived so that the calculation of the average velocity of the bead can be easily carried out. The formalism was applied to a simple three-state biochemical model to investigate how the velocity of the bead movement is affected by the external load, the diffusion coefficient of the bead, and the stiffness of the elastic element connecting the bead and the motor. The bead velocity was found to be critically dependent on the diffusion coefficient of the bead and the stiffness of the elastic element. A linear force-velocity relation was found for the model no matter whether the bead velocity was modulated by the diffusion coefficient of the bead or by the externally applied load. The formalism should be useful in modeling the mechanisms of chemimechanical coupling in kinesin motors based on in vitro motility data.},

abstract = {The genetic architecture of complex traits underlying physiology and disease in most organisms remains elusive. We still know little about the number of genes that underlie these traits, the magnitude of their effects, or the extent to which they interact. Chromosome substitution strains (CSSs) enable statistically powerful studies based on testing engineered inbred strains that have single, unique, and nonoverlapping genetic differences, thereby providing measures of phenotypic effects that are attributable to individual chromosomes. Here, we report a study of phenotypic effects and gene interactions for 90 blood, bone, and metabolic traits in a mouse CSS panel and 54 traits in a rat CSS panel. Two key observations emerge about the genetic architecture of these traits. First, the traits tend to be highly polygenic: across the genome, many individual chromosome substitutions each had significant phenotypic effects and, within each of the chromosomes studied, multiple distinct loci were found. Second, strong epistasis was found among the individual chromosomes. Specifically, individual chromosome substitutions often conferred surprisingly large effects (often a substantial fraction of the entire phenotypic difference between the parental strains), with the result that the sum of these individual effects often dramatically exceeded the difference between the parental strains. We suggest that strong, pervasive epistasis may reflect the presence of several phenotypically-buffered physiological states. These results have implications for identification of complex trait genes, developmental and physiological studies of phenotypic variation, and opportunities to engineer phenotypic outcomes in complex biological systems.},

abstract = {New strategies for prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) require improved insight into disease etiology. We analyzed 386,731 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1464 patients with T2D and 1467 matched controls, each characterized for measures of glucose metabolism, lipids, obesity, and blood pressure. With collaborators (FUSION and WTCCC/UKT2D), we identified and confirmed three loci associated with T2D-in a noncoding region near CDKN2A and CDKN2B, in an intron of IGF2BP2, and an intron of CDKAL1-and replicated associations near HHEX and in SLC30A8 found by a recent whole-genome association study. We identified and confirmed association of a SNP in an intron of glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR) with serum triglycerides. The discovery of associated variants in unsuspected genes and outside coding regions illustrates the ability of genome-wide association studies to provide potentially important clues to the pathogenesis of common diseases.},

title = {A unified model for functional and statistical epistasis and its application in quantitative trait Loci analysis},
abstract = {Interaction between genes, or epistasis, is found to be common and it is a key concept for understanding adaptation and evolution of natural populations, response to selection in breeding programs, and determination of complex disease. Currently, two independent classes of models are used to study epistasis. Statistical models focus on maintaining desired statistical properties for detection and estimation of genetic effects and for the decomposition of genetic variance using average effects of allele substitutions in populations as parameters. Functional models focus on the evolutionary consequences of the attributes of the genotype-phenotype map using natural effects of allele substitutions as parameters. Here we provide a new, general and unified model framework: the natural and orthogonal interactions (NOIA) model. NOIA implements tools for transforming genetic effects measured in one population to the ones of other populations (e.g., between two experimental designs for QTL) and parameters of statistical and functional epistasis into each other (thus enabling us to obtain functional estimates of QTL), as demonstrated numerically. We develop graphical interpretations of functional and statistical models as regressions of the genotypic values on the gene content, which illustrates the difference between the models--the constraint on the slope of the functional regression--and when the models are equivalent. Furthermore, we use our theoretical foundations to conceptually clarify functional and statistical epistasis, discuss the advantages of NOIA over previous theory, and stress the importance of linking functional and statistical models.},

Here we present a population genetic analysis of Drosophila simulans based on whole-genome shotgun sequencing of multiple inbred lines and comparison of the resulting data to genome assemblies of the closely related species, D. melanogaster and D. yakuba. We discovered previously unknown, large-scale fluctuations of polymorphism and divergence along chromosome arms, and significantly less polymorphism and faster divergence on the X chromosome. We generated a comprehensive list of functional elements in the D. simulans genome influenced by adaptive evolution. Finally, we characterized genomic patterns of base composition for coding and noncoding sequence. These results suggest several new hypotheses regarding the genetic and biological mechanisms controlling polymorphism and divergence across the Drosophila genome, and provide a rich resource for the investigation of adaptive evolution and functional variation in D. simulans.},

abstract = {We consider an asexual population evolving on rugged fitness landscapes which are defined on the multidimensional genotypic space and have many local optima. We track the most populated genotype as it changes when the population jumps from a fitness peak to a better one during the process of adaptation. This is done using the dynamics of the shell model which is a simplified version of the quasispecies model for infinite populations and standard Wright-Fisher dynamics for large finite populations. We show that the population fraction of a genotype obtained within the quasispecies model and the shell model match for fit genotypes and at short times, but the dynamics of the two models are identical for questions related to the most populated genotype. We calculate exactly several properties of the jumps in infinite populations, some of which were obtained numerically in previous works. We also present our preliminary simulation results for finite populations. In particular, we measure the jump distribution in time and find that it decays as t(-2) as in the quasispecies problem.},

abstract = {Understanding the role of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in controlling HIV-1 infection is vital for vaccine design. However, it is difficult to assess the importance of CTLs in natural infection. Different human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles are associated with different rates of progression to AIDS, indicating that CTLs play a protective role. Yet virus clearance rates following antiretroviral therapy are not impaired in individuals with advanced HIV disease, suggesting that weakening of the CTL response is not the major underlying cause of disease progression and that CTLs do not have an important protective role. Here we reconcile these apparently conflicting studies. We estimate the selection pressure exerted by CTL responses that drive the emergence of immune escape variants, thereby directly quantifying the efficiency of HIV-1-specific CTLs in vivo. We estimate that only 2% of productively infected CD4+ cell death is attributable to CTLs recognising a single epitope. We suggest that CTLs kill a large number of infected cells (about 10(7)) per day but are not responsible for the majority of infected cell death.},

title = {Substitution Processes in Molecular Evolution. {II.}~{E}xchangeable Models from Population Genetics},
abstract = {Substitution processes are of two sorts: origination processes record the times at which nucleotide mutations that ultimately fix in the population first appear, and fixation processes record the times at which they actually fix. Substitution processes may be generated by combining models of population genetics-here the symmetrical-neutral, overdominance, underdominance, TIM, and SAS-CFF models-with the infinite-sites, no-recombination model of the gene. This paper is mainly concerned with a computer simulation study of these substitution processes. The rate of substitution is shown to be remarkably insensitive to the strength of selection for models with strong balancing selection caused by the genealogical drift of mutations through alleles held in the population by selection. The origination process is shown to be more regular than Poisson for the overdominance, TIM, and SAS-CFF models but more clustered for the underdominance model. A class of point processes called Sawyer processes is introduced to help explain these observations as well as the observation that the times between successive originations are nearly uncorrelated. Fixation processes are shown to be more complex than origination processes, with regularly spaced bursts of multiple fixations. An approximation to the fixation process is described. One important conclusion is that protein evolution is not easily reconciled with any of these models without adding perturbations that recur on a time scale that is commensurate with that of molecular evolution.},

We report a detailed analysis of polymorphism distribution in multiple inbred mouse strains over a 4.8-megabase region containing a QTL influencing anxiety. Our analysis indicates that it is only partly true that the genomes of inbred strains exist as a patchwork of segments of sequence identity and difference. We show that the definition of haplotype blocks is not robust and that methods for QTL mapping may fail if they assume a simple block-like structure.},

abstract = {We study the time required for speciation in a species that is divided into small versus large populations. Following Dobzhansky and Muller, we assume that hybrid sterility or inviability is caused by ''complementary genes,'' that is, by the accumulation of genes that cause sterility or inviability when brought together in hybrids but that have no deleterious effect on their normal species genetic background. When divergence between populations is caused by genetic drift, we show that the time to speciation is independent of population subdivision: speciation occurs just as quickly in a species split into a few large populations as into many small populations. When divergence is driven by natural selection, however, the time to speciation is very sensitive to population subdivision and speciation occurs most rapidly when a species is split into two large populations. These results contradict several popular intuitions about the effect of population size on speciation.},

abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, more than 80% of the approximately 6200 predicted genes are nonessential, implying that the genome is buffered from the phenotypic consequences of genetic perturbation. To evaluate function, we developed a method for systematic construction of double mutants, termed synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis, in which a query mutation is crossed to an array of approximately 4700 deletion mutants. Inviable double-mutant meiotic progeny identify functional relationships between genes. SGA analysis of genes with roles in cytoskeletal organization (BNI1, ARP2, ARC40, BIM1), DNA synthesis and repair (SGS1, RAD27), or uncharacterized functions (BBC1, NBP2) generated a network of 291 interactions among 204 genes. Systematic application of this approach should produce a global map of gene function.},

title = {Heterosis and Outbreeding Depression in Interpopulation Crosses Spanning a Wide Range of Divergence},
abstract = {The intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus was used as a model organism to look at effects of crossing distance on fitness and to investigate the genetic mechanisms responsible. Crosses were conducted between 12 pairs of populations spanning a broad range of both geographic distance (5 m to 2007 km) and genetic distance (0.2% to 22.3% sequence divergence for a 606-bp segment of the mitochondrial COI gene). For each pair of populations, three fitness components (hatching number, survivorship number, and metamorphosis number) were measured in up to 16 cohorts including parentals, reciprocal F1, F2, F3, and first-generation backcross hybrids. Comparisons of each set of cohorts allowed estimation of within- and between-locus gene interaction. Relative to parentals, F1 hybrids showed a trend toward increased fitness, with no correspondence with population divergence, and a decrease in variance, which in some cases correlated with population divergence. In sharp contrast, F2 hybrids had a decrease in fitness and an increase in variance that both corresponded to population divergence. Genetic interpretation of these patterns suggests that both the beneficial effects of dominance and the detrimental effects of breaking up coadaptation are magnified by increasing evolutionary distance between populations. Because there is no recombination in T. californicus females, effects of recombination can be assessed by comparing F1 hybrid males and females backcrossed to parentals. Both recombinant and nonrecombinant backcross hybrids showed a decline in fitness correlated with population divergence, indicating that segregation among chromosomes contributes to the breakup of coadaptation. Although there was no difference in mean fitness between the two backcross types, recombinational backcrosses showed greater variance for fitness than nonrecombinational backcrosses, suggesting that the breakup of parental gene ombinations within chromosomes has both beneficial and detrimental effects.},

abstract = {Synergistic epistasis, in which deleterious mutations tend to magnify each other's effects, is a necessary component of the mutational deterministic hypothesis for the maintenance of sexual production. We tested for epistasis for life-history traits in the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans by inducing mutations in two genetic backgrounds: a wild-type strain and a set of genetically loaded lines that contain large numbers of independent mildly detrimental mutations. There was no significant difference between the effect of new mutations on the wild-type background and the genetically loaded background for four out of five fitness correlates. In these four cases, the maximum level of epistasis compatible with the data was very low. The fifth trait, late productivity, is not likely to be an important component of fitness. This suggests either that specific environmental conditions are required to cause epistasis or that synergistic epistasis is not a general phenomenon. We also suggest a new mechanism by which deleterious mutations may provide an advantage to sexual reproduction under low selection coefficients.},

title = {Positive and negative selection on noncoding DNA in Drosophila simulans},
abstract = {There is now a wealth of evidence that some of the most important regions of the genome are found outside those that encode proteins, and noncoding regions of the genome have been shown to be subject to substantial levels of selective constraint, particularly in Drosophila. Recent work has suggested that these regions may also have been subject to the action of positive selection, with large fractions of noncoding divergence having been driven to fixation by adaptive evolution. However, this work has focused on Drosophila melanogaster, which is thought to have experienced a reduction in effective population size (N(e)), and thus a reduction in the efficacy of selection, compared with its closest relative Drosophila simulans. Here, we examine patterns of evolution at several classes of noncoding DNA in D. simulans and find that all noncoding DNA is subject to the action of negative selection, indicated by reduced levels of polymorphism and divergence and a skew in the frequency spectrum toward rare variants. We find that the signature of negative selection on noncoding DNA and nonsynonymous sites is obscured to some extent by purifying selection acting on preferred to unpreferred synonymous codon mutations. We investigate the extent to which divergence in noncoding DNA is inferred to be the product of positive selection and to what extent these inferences depend on selection on synonymous sites and demography. Based on patterns of polymorphism and divergence for different classes of synonymous substitution, we find the divergence excess inferred in noncoding DNA and nonsynonymous sites in the D. simulans lineage difficult to reconcile with demographic explanations.},

abstract = {Sequence-specific binding of a transcription factor to DNA is the central event in any transcriptional regulatory network. However, relatively little is known about the evolutionary plasticity of transcription factors. For example, the exact functional consequence of an amino acid substitution on the DNA-binding specificity of most transcription factors is currently not predictable. Furthermore, although the major structural families of transcription factors have been identified, the detailed DNA-binding repertoires within most families have not been characterized. We studied the sequence recognition code and evolvability of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor family by creating all possible 95 single-point mutations of five DNA-contacting residues of Max, a human helix-loop-helix transcription factor and measured the detailed DNA-binding repertoire of each mutant. Our results show that the sequence-specific repertoire of Max accessible through single-point mutations is extremely limited, and we are able to predict 92% of the naturally occurring diversity at these positions. All naturally occurring basic regions were also found to be accessible through functional intermediates. Finally, we observed a set of amino acids that are functional in vitro but are not found to be used naturally, indicating that functionality alone is not sufficient for selection.},

title = {Varying environments can speed up evolution},
abstract = {Simulations of biological evolution, in which computers are used to evolve systems toward a goal, often require many generations to achieve even simple goals. It is therefore of interest to look for generic ways, compatible with natural conditions, in which evolution in simulations can be speeded. Here, we study the impact of temporally varying goals on the speed of evolution, defined as the number of generations needed for an initially random population to achieve a given goal. Using computer simulations, we find that evolution toward goals that change over time can, in certain cases, dramatically speed up evolution compared with evolution toward a fixed goal. The highest speedup is found under modularly varying goals, in which goals change over time such that each new goal shares some of the subproblems with the previous goal. The speedup increases with the complexity of the goal: the harder the problem, the larger the speedup. Modularly varying goals seem to push populations away from local fitness maxima, and guide them toward evolvable and modular solutions. This study suggests that varying environments might significantly contribute to the speed of natural evolution. In addition, it suggests a way to accelerate optimization algorithms and improve evolutionary approaches in engineering.},

Using structural, phylogenetic, and functional analysis, we identify the specific set of historical mutations that recapitulate the evolution of GR's hormone specificity from an MR-like ancestor. These substitutions repositioned crucial residues to create new receptor-ligand and intraprotein contacts. Strong epistatic interactions occur because one substitution changes the conformational position of another site. "Permissive" mutations-substitutions of no immediate consequence, which stabilize specific elements of the protein and allow it to tolerate subsequent function-switching changes-played a major role in determining GR's evolutionary trajectory.},

title = {Clustering of housekeeping genes provides a unified model of gene order in the human genome},
abstract = {It is often supposed that, except for tandem duplicates, genes are randomly distributed throughout the human genome. However, recent analyses suggest that when all the genes expressed in a given tissue (notably placenta and skeletal muscle) are examined, these genes do not map to random locations but instead resolve to clusters. We have asked three questions: (i) is this clustering true for most tissues, or are these the exceptions; (ii) is any clustering simply the result of the expression of tandem duplicates and (iii) how, if at all, does this relate to the observed clustering of genes with high expression rates? We provide a unified model of gene clustering that explains the previous observations. We examined Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) data for 14 tissues and found significant clustering, in each tissue, that persists even after the removal of tandem duplicates. We confirmed clustering by analysis of independent expressed-sequence tag (EST) data. We then tested the possibility that the human genome is organized into subregions, each specializing in genes needed in a given tissue. By comparing genes expressed in different tissues, we show that this is not the case: those genes that seem to be tissue-specific in their expression do not, as a rule, cluster. We report that genes that are expressed in most tissues (housekeeping genes) show strong clustering. In addition, we show that the apparent clustering of genes with high expression rates is a consequence of the clustering of housekeeping genes.},

abstract = {To investigate why human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) is less virulent than HIV-1, the evolution of coreceptor usage, autologous neutralization, envelope sequence and glycosylation was studied in sequentially obtained virus isolates and sera from four HIV-2-infected individuals. Neutralization of primary HIV-2 isolates was tested by a cell line-based assay and IgG purified from patients' sera. Significant autologous neutralization was observed for the majority (39 of 54) of the HIV-2 serum-virus combinations tested, indicating that neutralization escape is rare in HIV-2 infection. Furthermore, sera from 18 HIV-2 patients displayed extensive heterologous cross-neutralization when tested against a panel of six primary HIV-2 isolates. This indicates that HIV-2 is intrinsically more sensitive to antibody neutralization than HIV-1. In line with earlier reports, HIV-2 isolates could use several alternative receptors in addition to the major coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4. Intrapatient evolution from CCR5 use to CXCR4 use was documented for the first time. Furthermore, CXCR4 use was linked to the immunological status of the patients. Thus, all CXCR4-using isolates, except one, were obtained from patients with CD4 counts below 200 cells microl(-1). Sequence analysis revealed an association between coreceptor usage and charge of the V3 loop of the HIV-2 envelope, as well as an association between the rate of disease progression and the glycosylation pattern of the envelope protein. Furthermore, HIV-2 isolates had fewer glycosylation sites in the V3 domain than HIV-1 (two to three versus four to five). It is proposed here that HIV-2 has a more open and accessible V3 domain than HIV-1, due to differences in glycan packing, and that this may explain its broader coreceptor usage and greater sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies.},

Regulation of sets of adjacent genes by mechanisms operating at the level of chromosomal domains has been demonstrated in a number of cases, but the fraction of genes in the genome subject to regulation at this level is unknown. RESULTS: Drosophila gene-expression profiles that were determined from over 80 experimental conditions using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays were searched for groups of adjacent genes that show similar expression profiles. We found about 200 groups of adjacent and similarly expressed genes, each having between 10 and 30 members; together these groups account for over 20% of assayed genes. Each group covers between 20 and 200 kilobase pairs of genomic sequence, with a mean group size of about 100 kilobase pairs. Groups do not appear to show any correlation with polytene banding patterns or other known chromosomal structures, nor were genes within groups functionally related to one another. CONCLUSIONS: Groups of adjacent and co-regulated genes that are not otherwise functionally related in any obvious way can be identified by expression profiling in Drosophila. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not yet known.},

title = {Population extinction in a fluctuating environment},
abstract = { Environmental noise can cause an exponential reduction in the mean time to extinction (MTE) of an isolated population. We study this effect on an example of a stochastic birth-death process with rates modulated by a colored Gaussian noise. A path integral formulation yields a transparent way of evaluating the MTE and finding the optimal realization of the environmental noise that determines the most probable path to extinction. The population-size dependence of the MTE changes from exponential in the absence of the environmental noise to a power law for a short-correlated noise and to no dependence for long-correlated noise. We also establish the validity domains of the limits of white noise and adiabatic noise. },

Evolutionary analyses of amino acid sequences of this family of transcriptional activators suggest that the vertebrate genes MyoD1, myf-5, Myog (myogenin), and myf-6 were derived by gene duplications from a single ancestral gene. A common genetic origin predicts some functional redundancy between MyoD1 and myf-5 and between Myog and myf-6. Experimental studies have suggested that these pairs of genes can substitute for each other during myogenesis. Separate analyses of the conserved basic helix-loop-helix and nonconserved flanking elements yield similar branching sequences but show evolutionary change in the basic helix-loop-helix region has occurred at a much slower rate.},

title = {Reduced levels of DNA polymorphism and fixed between-population differences in the centromeric region of Drosophila ananassae},
abstract = {We have estimated DNA sequence variation within and between two populations of Drosophila ananassae, using six-cutter restriction site variation at vermilion (v) and furrowed (fw). These two gene regions are located close to the centromere on the left and right X chromosome arms, respectively. In the fw region, no DNA polymorphism was detected within each population. In the v region, average heterozygosity per nucleotide was very low in both populations (pi = 0.0005 in the Burma population, and 0.0009 in the India population). These estimates are significantly lower than those from loci in more distal gene regions. The distribution of DNA polymorphisms between both populations was also striking. At fw, three fixed differences between the Burma and India populations were detected (two restriction site differences and one insertion/deletion of approximately 2 kb). At v, each DNA polymorphism in high frequency in the total sample was nearly fixed in one or the other population, although none of them reached complete fixation. The observed pattern of reduced variation within populations and fixed differences between populations appears to correlate with recombination rate. We conclude that recent hitchhiking associated with directional selection is the best explanation for this pattern. The data indicate that different selective sweeps have occurred in the two populations. The possible role of genetic hitchhiking in rapid population differentiation in gene regions of restricted recombination is discussed.},

Despite these advances, there is much that remains to be understood about the epidemiology of influenza virus, particularly the processes that determine the virus's strong seasonality. We argue that a complete understanding of the evolutionary biology of this important human pathogen will require a genomic view of genetic diversity, including the acquisition of polymorphism data from within individual hosts and from geographical regions, particularly the tropics, which have been poorly surveyed to date.},

title = {Parallel changes in gene expression after 20,000 generations of evolution in Escherichiacoli},
abstract = {Twelve populations of Escherichia coli, derived from a common ancestor, evolved in a glucose-limited medium for 20,000 generations. Here we use DNA expression arrays to examine whether gene-expression profiles in two populations evolved in parallel, which would indicate adaptation, and to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying their adaptation. We compared the expression profile of the ancestor to that of clones sampled from both populations after 20,000 generations. The expression of 59 genes had changed significantly in both populations. Remarkably, all 59 were changed in the same direction relative to the ancestor. Many of these genes were members of the cAMP-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) regulons. Sequencing of several genes controlling the effectors of these regulons found a nonsynonymous mutation in spoT in one population. Moving this mutation into the ancestral background showed that it increased fitness and produced many of the expression changes manifest after 20,000 generations. The same mutation had no effect on fitness when introduced into the other evolved population, indicating that a mutation of similar effect was present already. Our study demonstrates the utility of expression arrays for addressing evolutionary issues including the quantitative measurement of parallel evolution in independent lineages and the identification of beneficial mutations.},

Two lager strains were shown to be hybrids between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the alloploid species Saccharomyces pastorianus. The genome structure of CBS 380(T), the type strain of Saccharomyces bayanus, is also consistent with S. pastorianus gene transfer. The results indicate that the cider yeast, CID1, possesses nuclear DNA from three separate species. Mating experiments show that there are no barriers to interspecific conjugation of haploid cells. Furthermore, the allopolyploid strains were able to undergo further hybridizations with other Saccharomyces sensu stricto yeasts. These results demonstrate that introgression between the Saccharomyces sensu stricto species is likely.},

title = {Single-nucleotide mutation rate increases close to insertions/deletions in eukaryotes},
abstract = {Mutation hotspots are commonly observed in genomic sequences and certain human disease loci, but general mechanisms for their formation remain elusive. Here we investigate the distribution of single-nucleotide changes around insertions/deletions (indels) in six independent genome comparisons, including primates, rodents, fruitfly, rice and yeast. In each of these genomic comparisons, nucleotide divergence (D) is substantially elevated surrounding indels and decreases monotonically to near-background levels over several hundred bases. D is significantly correlated with both size and abundance of nearby indels. In comparisons of closely related species, derived nucleotide substitutions surrounding indels occur in significantly greater numbers in the lineage containing the indel than in the one containing the ancestral (non-indel) allele; the same holds within species for single-nucleotide mutations surrounding polymorphic indels. We propose that heterozygosity for an indel is mutagenic to surrounding sequences, and use yeast genome-wide polymorphism data to estimate the increase in mutation rate. The consistency of these patterns within and between species suggests that indel-associated substitution is a general mutational mechanism.},

title = {Programming cells by multiplex genome engineering and accelerated evolution},
abstract = {The breadth of genomic diversity found among organisms in nature allows populations to adapt to diverse environments. However, genomic diversity is difficult to generate in the laboratory and new phenotypes do not easily arise on practical timescales. Although in vitro and directed evolution methods have created genetic variants with usefully altered phenotypes, these methods are limited to laborious and serial manipulation of single genes and are not used for parallel and continuous directed evolution of gene networks or genomes. Here, we describe multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) for large-scale programming and evolution of cells. MAGE simultaneously targets many locations on the chromosome for modification in a single cell or across a population of cells, thus producing combinatorial genomic diversity. Because the process is cyclical and scalable, we constructed prototype devices that automate the MAGE technology to facilitate rapid and continuous generation of a diverse set of genetic changes (mismatches, insertions, deletions). We applied MAGE to optimize the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli to overproduce the industrially important isoprenoid lycopene. Twenty-four genetic components in the DXP pathway were modified simultaneously using a complex pool of synthetic DNA, creating over 4.3 billion combinatorial genomic variants per day. We isolated variants with more than fivefold increase in lycopene production within 3 days, a significant improvement over existing metabolic engineering techniques. Our multiplex approach embraces engineering in the context of evolution by expediting the design and evolution of organisms with new and improved properties.},

abstract = {The role of each histone tail in regulating chromatin structure is elucidated by using a coarse-grained model of an oligonucleosome incorporating flexible histone tails that reproduces the conformational and dynamical properties of chromatin. Specifically, a tailored configurational-bias Monte Carlo method that efficiently samples the possible conformational states of oligonucleosomes yields positional distributions of histone tails around nucleosomes and illuminates the nature of tail/core/DNA interactions at various salt milieus. Analyses indicate that the H4 histone tails are most important in terms of mediating internucleosomal interactions, especially in highly compact chromatin with linker histones, followed by H3, H2A, and H2B tails in decreasing order of importance. In addition to mediating internucleosomal interactions, the H3 histone tails crucially screen the electrostatic repulsion between the entering/exiting DNA linkers. The H2A and H2B tails distribute themselves along the periphery of chromatin fibers and are important for mediating fiber/fiber interactions. A delicate balance between tail-mediated internucleosomal attraction and repulsion among linker DNAs allows the entering/exiting linker DNAs to align perpendicular to each other in linker-histone deficient chromatin, leading to the formation of an irregular zigzag-folded fiber with dominant pair-wise interactions between nucleosomes i and i +/- 4.},

title = {Can three-dimensional contacts in protein structures be predicted by analysis of correlated mutations?},
abstract = {A method has been developed to detect pairs of positions with correlated mutations in protein multiple sequence alignments. The method is based on reconstruction of the phylogenetic tree for a set of sequences and statistical analysis of the distribution of mutations in the branches of the tree. The database of homology-derived protein structures (HSSP) is used as the source of multiple sequence alignments for proteins of known three-dimensional structure. We analyse pairs of positions with correlated mutations in 67 protein families and show quantitatively that the presence of such positions is a typical feature of protein families. A significant but weak tendency is observed for correlated residue pairs to be close in the three-dimensional structure. With further improvements, methods of this type may be useful for the prediction of residue--residue contacts and subsequent prediction of protein structure using distance geometry algorithms. In conclusion, we suggest a new experimental approach to protein structure determination in which selection of functional mutants after random mutagenesis and analysis of correlated mutations provide sufficient proximity constraints for calculation of the protein fold.},

The commercially available linear unmixing algorithms efficiently remove the contribution of donor spectral bleedthrough to the FRET signal. However, the acceptor contribution to spectral bleedthrough in the FRET image cannot be similarly removed, since the acceptor spectrum is identical to the FRET spectrum. Here, we describe the development of a computer algorithm that measures and removes the contaminating ASBT signal in the sFRET image. The new method is characterized in living cells that expressed FRET standards in which the donor and acceptor fluorescent proteins are tethered by amino acid linkers of specific lengths. The method is then used to detect the homo-dimerization of a transcription factor in the nucleus of living cells, and then to measure the interactions of that protein with a second transcription factor.},

abstract = {The HA1 domain of HA, the major antigenic protein of influenza A viruses, contains all of the antigenic sites of HA and is under continual immune-driven selection. To resolve controversies on whether only a few or many residue sites of HA1 have undergone positive selection, whether positive selection at HA1 is continual or punctuated, and whether antigenic change is punctuated, we introduce an approach to analyze 2,248 HA1 sequences collected from 1968 to 2005. We identify 95 substitutions at 63 sites from 1968 to 2005 and show that each substitution occurred very rapidly. The rapid substitution and the fact that 57 of the 63 sites are antigenic sites indicate that hitchhiking plays a minor role and that most of these sites, many more than previously found, have undergone positive selection. Strikingly, 88 of the 95 substitutions occurred in groups, and multiple mutations at antigenic sites sped up the fixation process. Our results suggest that positive selection has been ongoing most of the time, not sporadic, and that multiple mutations at antigenic sites cumulatively enhance antigenic drift, indicating that antigenic change is less punctuated than recently proposed.},

title = {THE GENETIC ARCHITECTURE OF METABOLIC RATE: ENVIRONMENT SPECIFIC EPISTASIS BETWEEN MITOCHONDRIAL AND NUCLEAR GENES IN AN INSECT},
abstract = {The extent to which mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation is involved in adaptive evolutionary change is currently being reevaluated. In particular, emerging evidence suggests that mtDNA genes coevolve with the nuclear genes with which they interact to form the energy producing enzyme complexes in the mitochondria. This suggests that intergenomic epistasis between mitochondrial and nuclear genes may affect whole-organism metabolic phenotypes. Here, we use crossed combinations of mitochondrial and nuclear lineages of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus and assay metabolic rate under two different temperature regimes. Metabolic rate was affected by an interaction between the mitochondrial and nuclear lineages and the temperature regime. Sequence data suggests that mitochondrial genetic variation has a role in determining the outcome of this interaction. Our genetic dissection of metabolic rate reveals a high level of complexity, encompassing genetic interactions over two genomes, and genotype × genotype × environment interactions. The evolutionary implications of these results are twofold. First, because metabolic rate is at the root of life histories, our results provide insights into the complexity of life history evolution in general, and thermal adaptation in particular. Second, our results suggest a mechanism that could contribute to the maintenance of non-neutral mtDNA polymorphism.},

To investigate how, we engineered a synthetic library of 154 genes that varied randomly at synonymous sites, but all encoded the same green fluorescent protein (GFP). When expressed in Escherichia coli, GFP protein levels varied 250-fold across the library. GFP messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, mRNA degradation patterns, and bacterial growth rates also varied, but codon bias did not correlate with gene expression. Rather, the stability of mRNA folding near the ribosomal binding site explained more than half the variation in protein levels. In our analysis, mRNA folding and associated rates of translation initiation play a predominant role in shaping expression levels of individual genes, whereas codon bias influences global translation efficiency and cellular fitness.},

title = {Emerging principles of regulatory evolution},
abstract = {Understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms governing the evolution of morphology is a major challenge in biology. Because most animals share a conserved repertoire of body-building and -patterning genes, morphological diversity appears to evolve primarily through changes in the deployment of these genes during development. The complex expression patterns of developmentally regulated genes are typically controlled by numerous independent cis-regulatory elements (CREs). It has been proposed that morphological evolution relies predominantly on changes in the architecture of gene regulatory networks and in particular on functional changes within CREs. Here, we discuss recent experimental studies that support this hypothesis and reveal some unanticipated features of how regulatory evolution occurs. From this growing body of evidence, we identify three key operating principles underlying regulatory evolution, that is, how regulatory evolution: (i) uses available genetic components in the form of preexisting and active transcription factors and CREs to generate novelty; (ii) minimizes the penalty to overall fitness by introducing discrete changes in gene expression; and (iii) allows interactions to arise among any transcription factor and downstream CRE. These principles endow regulatory evolution with a vast creative potential that accounts for both relatively modest morphological differences among closely related species and more profound anatomical divergences among groups at higher taxonomical levels.},

title = {Selfish operons: horizontal transfer may drive the evolution of gene clusters},
abstract = {A model is presented whereby the formation of gene clusters in bacteria is mediated by transfer of DNA within and among taxa. Bacterial operons are typically composed of genes whose products contribute to a single function. If this function is subject to weak selection or to long periods with no selection, the contributing genes may accumulate mutations and be lost by genetic drift. From a cell's perspective, once several genes are lost, the function can be restored only if all missing genes were acquired simultaneously by lateral transfer. The probability of transfer of multiple genes increases when genes are physically proximate. From a gene's perspective horizontal transfer provides a way to escape evolutionary loss by allowing colonization of organisms lacking the encoded functions. Since organism bearing clustered genes are more likely to act as successful donors, clustered genes would spread among bacterial genomes. The physical proximity of genes may be considered a selfish property of the operon since it affects the probability of successful horizontal transfer but may provide no physiological benefit to the host. This process predicts a mosaic structure of modern genomes in which ancestral chromosomal material is interspersed with novel, horizontally transferred operons providing peripheral metabolic functions.},

This difference has evolved by the accumulation of neutral mutations by random drift, the fixation of adaptive mutations by selection, or a mixture of the two. Here we propose a simple statistical test of the neutral protein evolution hypothesis based on a comparison of the number of amino-acid replacement substitutions to synonymous substitutions in the coding region of a locus. If the observed substitutions are neutral, the ratio of replacement to synonymous fixed differences between species should be the same as the ratio of replacement to synonymous polymorphisms within species. DNA sequence data on the Adh locus (encoding alcohol dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.1.1) in three species in the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup do not fit this expectation; instead, there are more fixed replacement differences between species than expected. We suggest that these excess replacement substitutions result from adaptive fixation of selectively advantageous mutations.},

Not every mutation under positive selection responds to a change in selection: beneficial changes also occur at evolutionary equilibrium, repairing previous deleterious changes and restoring existing functions. Adaptation, by contrast, is viewed here as a non-equilibrium phenomenon: the genomic response to time-dependent selection. Our approach extends the static concept of fitness landscapes to dynamic fitness seascapes. It shows that adaptation requires a surplus of beneficial substitutions over deleterious ones. Here, we focus on the evolution of yeast and Drosophila genomes, providing examples where adaptive evolution can and cannot be inferred, despite the presence of positive selection.},

title = {Requisite mutational load, pathway epistasis and deterministic mutation accumulation in sexual versus asexual populations},
abstract = {A measure of the equilibrium load of deleterious mutations is developed that explicitly incorporates the level of genome-wide linkage disequilibrium. This measure, called the requisite mutational load, is based on the minimal net reproductive rate of the least mutated class necessary to prevent the deterministic mutation accumulation. If this minimal net reproductive rate is larger than ecological or physiological constraints allow, then: a) the population is driven to extinction via deterministic mutation accumulation, or b) a mutational Red-Queen ensues with adaptation counterbalancing mutation accumulation. Two population parameters determine the requisite mutational load: a) the equilibrium strength of selection, measured as a selection gradient, and b) the equilibrium opportunity for selection, measured as the variance in number of mutations per genome. The opportunity for selection is decomposed into the accumulation of mutations (average number per genome) and the level of genome-wide linkage disequilibrium. Recombination can substantially reduce the requisite mutational load, compared to clonal reproduction, when there is buffering and/or reinforcing epistasis and also when there is positive assortative mating for fitness. Recombination is advantageous because it reduces the negative (variance reducing) linkage disequilibrium induced by beneficial epistasis. The functional form of the expression for requisite mutational load illustrates why epistasis within pathways, i.e., among closely interacting genes, is a powerful alternative to genome-wide truncation selection, as a means of reducing mutational load.},

title = {Why Sex and Recombination?},
abstract = {Sex and recombination have long been seen as adaptations that facilitate natural selection by generating favorable variations. If recombination is to aid selection, there must be negative linkage disequilibria-favorable alleles must be found together less often than expected by chance. These negative linkage disequilibria can be generated directly by selection, but this must involve negative epistasis of just the right strength, which is not expected, from either experiment or theory. Random drift provides a more general source of negative associations: Favorable mutations almost always arise on different genomes, and negative associations tend to persist, precisely because they shield variation from selection. We can understand how recombination aids adaptation by determining the maximum possible rate of adaptation. With unlinked loci, this rate increases only logarithmically with the influx of favorable mutations. With a linear genome, a scaling argument shows that in a large population, the rate of adaptive substitution depends only on the expected rate in the absence of interference, divided by the total rate of recombination. A two-locus approximation predicts an upper bound on the rate of substitution, proportional to recombination rate. If associations between linked loci do impede adaptation, there can be substantial selection for modifiers that increase recombination. Whether this can account for the maintenance of high rates of sex and recombination depends on the extent of selection. It is clear that the rate of species-wide substitutions is typically far too low to generate appreciable selection for recombination. However, local sweeps within a subdivided population may be effective.},

abstract = {Fisher and Muller's theory that recombination speeds adaptation by eliminating competition among beneficial mutations has proved a popular explanation for the advantage of sex. Recent theoretical studies have attempted to quantify the speed of adaptation under the Fisher-Muller model, partly in an attempt to understand the role of "clonal interference" in microbial experimental evolution. We reexamine adaptation in sexuals vs. asexuals, using a model of DNA sequence evolution. In this model, a modest number of sites can mutate to beneficial alleles and the fitness effects of these mutations are unequal. We study (1) transition probabilities to different beneficial mutations; (2) waiting times to the first and the last substitutions of beneficial mutations; and (3) trajectories of mean fitness through time. We find that some of these statistics are surprisingly similar between sexuals and asexuals. These results highlight the importance of the choice of substitution model in assessing the Fisher-Muller advantage of sex.},

title = {The origins of specificity in polyketide synthase protein interactions},
abstract = {Polyketides, a diverse group of heteropolymers with antibiotic and antitumor properties, are assembled in bacteria by multiprotein chains of modular polyketide synthase (PKS) proteins. Specific protein-protein interactions determine the order of proteins within a multiprotein chain, and thereby the order in which chemically distinct monomers are added to the growing polyketide product. Here we investigate the evolutionary and molecular origins of protein interaction specificity. We focus on the short, conserved N- and C-terminal docking domains that mediate interactions between modular PKS proteins. Our computational analysis, which combines protein sequence data with experimental protein interaction data, reveals a hierarchical interaction specificity code. PKS docking domains are descended from a single ancestral interacting pair, but have split into three phylogenetic classes that are mutually noninteracting. Specificity within one such compatibility class is determined by a few key residues, which can be used to define compatibility subclasses. We identify these residues using a novel, highly sensitive co-evolution detection algorithm called CRoSS (correlated residues of statistical significance). The residue pairs selected by CRoSS are involved in direct physical interactions in a docked-domain NMR structure. A single PKS system can use docking domain pairs from multiple classes, as well as domain pairs from multiple subclasses of any given class. The termini of individual proteins are frequently shuffled, but docking domain pairs straddling two interacting proteins are linked as an evolutionary module. The hierarchical and modular organization of the specificity code is intimately related to the processes by which bacteria generate new PKS pathways.},

Inbred strains of mice provide a unique opportunity for exploring these relationships, representing as they do, diverse genomes originally separated by millions of generations that were then scrambled in the laboratory and subjected to intense selection during inbreeding to homozygosity. Here we show that the resulting pattern of chromosome organization includes regional domains of functionally related elements that promote the co-inheritance and survival of compatible sets of alleles. There are also patterns of linkage disequilibrium between domains on separate chromosomes; these are distinctly non-random and form networks with scale-free architecture. The strong conservation of gene order among mammals suggests that the domains and networks we find likely characterize all mammals, and possibly beyond.},

Here, we studied system-level epistatic interactions by computing growth phenotypes of all single and double knockouts of 890 metabolic genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using the framework of flux balance analysis. A new scale for epistasis identified a distinctive trimodal distribution of these epistatic effects, allowing gene pairs to be classified as buffering, aggravating or noninteracting. We found that the ensuing epistatic interaction network could be organized hierarchically into function-enriched modules that interact with each other 'monochromatically' (i.e., with purely aggravating or purely buffering epistatic links). This property extends the concept of epistasis from single genes to functional units and provides a new definition of biological modularity, which emphasizes interactions between, rather than within, functional modules. Our approach can be used to infer functional gene modules from purely phenotypic epistasis measurements.},

title = {Dynamics of hybrid incompatibility in gene networks in a constant environment},
abstract = {After an ancestral population splits into two allopatric populations, different mutations may fix in each. When pairs of mutations are brought together in a hybrid offspring, epistasis may cause reduced fitness. Such pairs are known as Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller (BDM) incompatibilities. A well-known model of BDM incompatibility due to Orr suggests that the fitness load on hybrids should initially accelerate, and continue to increase as the number of potentially incompatible substitutions increases (the "snowball effect"). In the gene networks model, which violates a key assumption of Orr's model (independence of fixation probabilities), the snowball effect often does not occur. Instead, we describe three possible dynamics in a constant environment: (1) Stabilizing selection can constrain two allopatric populations to remain near-perfectly compatible. (2) Despite constancy of environment, punctuated evolution may obtain; populations may experience rare adaptations asynchronously, permitting incompatibility. (3) Despite stabilizing selection, developmental system drift may permit genetic change, allowing two populations to drift in and out of compatibility. We reinterpret Orr's model in terms of genetic distance. We extend Orr's model to the finite loci case, which can limit incompatibility. Finally, we suggest that neutral evolution of gene regulation in nature, to the point of speciation, is a distinct possibility.},

Instead, adaptation often involves a modest number of factors of large effect and a greater number of factors of smaller effect. After reviewing relevant experimental studies, I consider recent theoretical attempts to predict the genetic architecture of adaptation from first principles. In particular, I review the history of work on Fisher's geometric model of adaptation, including recent studies which suggest that adaptation should be characterized by exponential distributions of gene effects. I also present the results of new simulation studies that test the robustness of this finding.

abstract = {We predict a temperature-driven phase transition of DNA below the melting transition. The additional, intermediate phase exists for repetitive sequences, when the two strands have different lengths. In this phase, the excess bases of the longer strand are completely absorbed as bulge loops inside the helical region. When the temperature is lowered, the excess bases desorb into overhanging ends, resulting in a contour length change. This continuous transition is in many aspects analogous to Bose-Einstein condensation. When the sequence is weakly disordered, the contour length changes discontinuously with temperature.},

title = {Loss of lipid synthesis as an evolutionary consequence of a parasitic lifestyle},
abstract = {Evolutionary loss of traits can result from negative selection on a specific phenotype, or if the trait is selectively neutral, because the phenotype associated with the trait has become redundant. Even essential traits may be lost, however, if the resulting phenotypic deficiencies can be compensated for by the environment or a symbiotic partner. Here we demonstrate that loss of an essential me-tabolic trait in parasitic wasps has evolved through environmental compensation. We tested 24 species for the ability to synthesize lipids de novo and collected additional data from the literature. We found the majority of adult parasitoid species to be incapable of synthesizing lipids, and phylogenetic analyses showed that the evolution of lack of lipogenesis is concurrent with that of parasitism in insects. Exploitive host manipulation, in which the host is forced to synthesize lipids to the benefit of the parasitoid, presumably facilitates loss of lipogenesis through environmental compensation. Lipogenesis re-evolved in a small number of parasitoid species, particularly host generalists. The wide range of host species in which generalists are able to develop may impede effective host manipulation and could have resulted in regaining of lipogenic ability in generalist parasitoids. As trait loss through environmental compensation is unnoticed at the phenotypic level, it may be more common than currently anticipated, especially in species involved in intricate symbiotic relationships with other species.},

abstract = {Chromatin allows the eukaryotic cell to package its DNA efficiently. To understand how chromatin structure is controlled across the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, we have investigated the role of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complex Isw2 in positioning nucleosomes. We find that Isw2 functions adjacent to promoter regions where it repositions nucleosomes at the interface between genic and intergenic sequences. Nucleosome repositioning by Isw2 is directional and results in increased nucleosome occupancy of the intergenic region. Loss of Isw2 activity leads to inappropriate transcription, resulting in the generation of both coding and noncoding transcripts. Here we show that Isw2 repositions nucleosomes to enforce directionality on transcription by preventing transcription initiation from cryptic sites. Our analyses reveal how chromatin is organized on a global scale and advance our understanding of how transcription is regulated.},

abstract = {Large-scale association studies hold substantial promise for unraveling the genetic basis of common human diseases. A well-known problem with such studies is the presence of undetected population structure, which can lead to both false positive results and failures to detect genuine associations. Here we examine approximately 15,000 genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms typed in three population groups to assess the consequences of population structure on the coming generation of association studies. The consequences of population structure on association outcomes increase markedly with sample size. For the size of study needed to detect typical genetic effects in common diseases, even the modest levels of population structure within population groups cannot safely be ignored. We also examine one method for correcting for population structure (Genomic Control). Although it often performs well, it may not correct for structure if too few loci are used and may overcorrect in other settings, leading to substantial loss of power. The results of our analysis can guide the design of large-scale association studies.},

title = {Mechanical feedback as a possible regulator of tissue growth},
abstract = {Regulation of cell growth and proliferation has a fundamental role in animal and plant development and in the progression of cancer. In the context of development, it is important to understand the mechanisms that coordinate growth and patterning of tissues. Imaginal discs, which are larval precursors of fly limbs and organs, have provided much of what we currently know about these processes. Here, we consider the mechanism that is responsible for the observed uniformity of growth in wing imaginal discs, which persists in the presence of gradients in growth inducing morphogens in spite of the stochastic nature of cell division. The phenomenon of "cell competition," which manifests in apoptosis of slower-growing cells in the vicinity of faster growing tissue, suggests that uniform growth is not a default state but a result of active regulation. How can a patch of tissue compare its growth rate with that of its surroundings? A possible way is furnished by mechanical interactions. To demonstrate this mechanism, we formulate a mathematical model of nonuniform growth in a layer of tissue and examine its mechanical implications. We show that a clone growing faster or slower than the surrounding tissue is subject to mechanical stress, and we propose that dependence of the rate of cell division on local stress could provide an "integral-feedback" mechanism stabilizing uniform growth. The proposed mechanism of growth control is not specific to imaginal disc growth and could be of general relevance. Several experimental tests of the proposed mechanism are suggested.},

However, no clear correlates of T cell-mediated immune protection have been identified. Here, we examine in a HLA-B27(+) HIV seronegative vaccinee persistent HIV-specific vaccine-induced anti-Gag CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses. Although these responses exhibited those characteristics (multifunctionality, appropriate memory phenotype, and targeting of epitopes associated with long-term nonprogression) predicted to correlate with protection from infection, the subject became HIV infected. After HIV infection, the vaccine-induced CD8(+) T cells expanded, but both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses acquired the functional and phenotypic patterns characteristic of chronic HIV infection. The virus quickly escaped the vaccine-induced T cell response, and the subject progressed more rapidly than expected for someone expressing the HLA-B27 allele. These data suggest that control of HIV by vaccine-elicited HIV-specific T cell responses may be difficult, even when the T cell response has those characteristics predicted to provide optimal protection.},

title = {Genome-wide comparisons of variation in linkage disequilibrium},
abstract = {Current genome-wide surveys of common diseases and complex traits fundamentally aim to detect indirect associations where the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) carrying the association signals are not biologically active but are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with some unknown functional polymorphisms. Reproducing any novel discoveries from these genome-wide scans in independent studies is now a prerequisite for the putative findings to be accepted. Significant differences in patterns of LD between populations can affect the portability of phenotypic associations when the replication effort or meta-analyses are attempted in populations that are distinct from the original population in which the genome-wide study is performed. Here, we introduce a novel method for genome-wide analyses of LD variations between populations that allow the identification of candidate regions with different patterns of LD. The evidence of LD variation provided by the introduced method correlated with the degree of differences in the frequencies of the most common haplotype across the populations. Identified regions also resulted in greater variation in the success of replication attempts compared with random regions in the genome. A separate permutation strategy introduced for assessing LD variation in the absence of genome-wide data also correctly identified the expected variation in LD patterns in two well-established regions undergoing strong population-specific evolutionary pressure. Importantly, this method addresses whether a failure to reproduce a disease association in a disparate population is due to underlying differences in LD structure with an unknown functional polymorphism, which is vital in the current climate of replicating and fine-mapping established findings from genome-wide association studies.},

Now, the abundance of genetic markers has made it possible to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL)--the regions of a chromosome or, ideally, individual sequence variants that are responsible for trait variation. What kind of QTL do we expect to find and what can our observations of QTL tell us about how organisms evolve? The key to understanding the evolutionary significance of QTL is to understand the nature of inherited variation, not in the immediate mechanistic sense of how genes influence phenotype, but, rather, to know what evolutionary forces maintain genetic variability.},

title = {Evidence for widespread adaptive evolution of gene expression in budding yeast},
abstract = {Changes in gene expression have been proposed to underlie many, or even most, adaptive differences between species. Despite the increasing acceptance of this view, only a handful of cases of adaptive gene expression evolution have been demonstrated. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a simple test for lineage-specific selection on gene expression. Applying the test to genome-wide gene expression data from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we find that hundreds of gene expression levels have been subject to lineage-specific selection. Comparing these findings with independent population genetic evidence of selective sweeps suggests that this lineage-specific selection has resulted in recent sweeps at over a hundred genes, most of which led to increased transcript levels. Examination of the implicated genes revealed a specific biochemical pathway-ergosterol biosynthesis-where the expression of multiple genes has been subject to selection for reduced levels. In sum, these results suggest that adaptive evolution of gene expression is common in yeast, that regulatory adaptation can occur at the level of entire pathways, and that similar genome-wide scans may be possible in other species, including humans.},

title = {Differential recruitment of limb patterning genes during development and diversification of beetle horns},
abstract = {The origins of novel complex phenotypes represent one of the most fundamental, yet largely unresolved, issues in evolutionary biology. Here we explore the developmental genetic regulation of beetle horns, a class of traits that lacks obvious homology to traits in other insects. Furthermore, beetle horns are remarkably diverse in their expression, including sexual dimorphisms, male dimorphisms, and interspecific differences in location of horn expression. At the same time, beetle horns share aspects of their development with that of more traditional appendages. We used larval RNA interference-mediated gene function analysis of 3 cardinal insect appendage patterning genes,dachshund, homothorax, and Distal-less, to investigate their role in development and diversification of beetle horns within and between species. Transcript depletion of all 3 patterning genes generated phenotypic effects very similar to those documented in previous studies that focused on general insect development. In addition, we found that Distal-less and homothorax, but not dachshund, regulate horn expression in a species-, sex-, body region-, and body size-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate differential co-option of appendage patterning genes during the evolution and radiation of beetle horns. Furthermore, our results illustrate that regulatory genes whose functions are otherwise highly conserved nevertheless retain the capacity to acquire additional functions, and that little phylogenetic distance appears necessary for the evolution of sex- and species-specific differences in these functions.},

title = {Mapping protease inhibitor resistance to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 sequence polymorphisms within patients},
abstract = {Resistance genotyping provides an important resource for the clinical management of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). However, resistance to protease (PR) inhibitors (PIs) is a complex phenotype shaped by interactions among nearly half of the residues in HIV-1 PR. Previous studies of the genetic basis of PI resistance focused on fixed substitutions among populations of HIV-1, i.e., host-specific adaptations. Consequently, they are susceptible to a high false discovery rate due to founder effects. Here, we employ sequencing "mixtures" (i.e., ambiguous base calls) as a site-specific marker of genetic variation within patients that is independent of the phylogeny. We demonstrate that the transient response to selection by PIs is manifested as an excess of nonsynonymous mixtures. Using a sample of 5,651 PR sequences isolated from both PI-naive and -treated patients, we analyze the joint distribution of mixtures and eight PIs as a Bayesian network, which distinguishes residue-residue interactions from direct associations with PIs. We find that selection for resistance is associated with the emergence of nonsynonymous mixtures in two distinct groups of codon sites clustered along the substrate cleft and distal regions of PR, respectively. Within-patient evolution at several positions is independent of PIs, including those formerly postulated to be involved in resistance. These positions are under strong positive selection in the PI-naive patient population, implying that other factors can produce spurious associations with resistance, e.g., mutational escape from the immune response.},

title = {Coexpression of neighboring genes in Caenorhabditis elegans is mostly due to operons and duplicate genes},
abstract = {In many eukaryotic species, gene order is not random. In humans, flies, and yeast, there is clustering of coexpressed genes that cannot be explained as a trivial consequence of tandem duplication. In the worm genome this is taken a step further with many genes being organized into operons. Here we analyze the relationship between gene location and expression in Caenorhabditis elegans and find evidence for at least three different processes resulting in local expression similarity. Not surprisingly, the strongest effect comes from genes organized in operons. However, coexpression within operons is not perfect, and is influenced by some distance-dependent regulation. Beyond operons, there is a relationship between physical distance, expression similarity, and sequence similarity, acting over several megabases. This is consistent with a model of tandem duplicate genes diverging over time in sequence and expression pattern, while moving apart owing to chromosomal rearrangements. However, at a very local level, nonduplicate genes on opposite strands (hence not in operons) show similar expression patterns. This suggests that such genes may share regulatory elements or be regulated at the level of chromatin structure. The central importance of tandem duplicate genes in these patterns renders the worm genome different from both yeast and human.},

title = {Rapid, phenotypic HIV-1 drug sensitivity assay for protease and reverse transcriptase inhibitors},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Development of drug resistance is one of the major reasons for the failure of antiretroviral therapy of HIV-1 infection. Knowing the drug sensitivity-resistance profile of viruses present in a patient prior to treatment or change in treatment could help to optimize therapy. OBJECTIVE: Development of a rapid standardized phenotypic HIV-1 drug sensitivity assay for protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors. DESIGN: The PR gene (codons 1-99) and the 5' part of the RT gene (codons 1-300) of HIV-1 is amplified from the plasma of infected individuals by RT-PCR and ligated into a proviral clone of HIV-1 containing a deletion of the PR gene and the 5' part of the RT gene. Bacteria are transformed with the ligation product and plasmid DNA is prepared from a library of transformed bacteria. The plasmid DNA is transfected into 293 T cells and recombinant virus is harvested from the supernatant of the transfected cells 2 days after transfection. The sensitivity of the recombinant virus is determined with the help of a sensitive indicator cell line. RESULTS: Recombinant viruses were generated with high efficiency. Determination of the drug sensitivity of the recombinant viruses with an indicator cell line was highly reproducible. The recombinant viruses accurately reflected the sensitivity-resistance profile of the parental viruses. The phenotypic drug sensitivity determined by this assay correlated well with the treatment history of patients. CONCLUSION: This assay system should allow rapid, high-throughput analyses of phenotypic HIV-1 drug sensitivity for PR and RT inhibitors. Due to the efficient generation of recombinant viruses, propagation of the recombinant viruses in cell culture is not required prior to the determination of the sensitivity of the recombinant viruses. The risk of selecting fitter non-resistant viruses due to culture conditions is minimized.},

title = {Perspective: Sign epistasis and genetic constraint on evolutionary trajectories},
abstract = {Epistasis for fitness means that the selective effect of a mutation is conditional on the genetic background in which it appears. Although epistasis is widely observed in nature, our understanding of its consequences for evolution by natural selection remains incomplete. In particular, much attention focuses only on its influence on the instantaneous rate of changes in frequency of selected alleles via epistatic contribution to the additive genetic variance for fitness. Thus, in this framework epistasis only has evolutionary importance if the interacting loci are simultaneously segregating in the population. However, the selective accessibility of mutational trajectories to high fitness genotypes may depend on the genetic background in which novel mutations appear, and this effect is independent of population polymorphism at other loci. Here we explore this second influence of epistasis on evolution by natural selection. We show that it is the consequence of a particular form of epistasis, which we designate sign epistasis. Sign epistasis means that the sign of the fitness effect of a mutation is under epistatic control; thus, such a mutation is beneficial on some genetic backgrounds and deleterious on others. Recent experimental innovations in microbial systems now permit assessment of the fitness effects of individual mutations on multiple genetic backgrounds. We review this literature and identify many examples of sign epistasis, and we suggest that the implications of these results may generalize to other organisms. These theoretical and empirical considerations imply that strong genetic constraint on the selective accessibility of trajectories to high fitness genotypes may exist and suggest specific areas of investigation for future research.},

title = {Efficiency of truncation selection},
abstract = {Truncation selection is known to be the most efficient form of directional selection. When this is modified so that the fitness increases linearly over a range of one or two standard deviations of the value of the selected character, the efficiency is reduced, but not greatly. When truncation selection is compared to a system in which fitness is strictly proportional to the character value, the relative efficiency of truncation selection is given by f(c)/sigma, in which f(c) is the ordinate of the frequency distribution at the truncation point and sigma is the standard deviation of the character. It is shown, for mutations affecting viability in Drosophila, that truncation selection or reasonable departures therefrom can reduce the mutation load greatly. This may be one way to reconcile the very high mutation rate of such genes with a small mutation load. The truncation model with directional selection is appropriate for this situation because of the approximate additivity of these mutations. On the other hand, it is doubtful that this simple model can be applied to all genes affecting fitness, for which there are intermediate optima and antagonistic selection among components with negative correlations. Whether nature ranks and truncates, or approximates this behavior, is an empirical question, yet to be answered.},

abstract = {Fisher's geometric model of adaptive evolution argues that adaptive evolution should generally result from the substitution of many mutations of small effect because advantageous mutations of small effect should be more common than those of large effect. However, evidence for both evolution by small steps and for Fisher's model has been mixed. Here we report supporting results from a new experimental test of the model. We subjected the bacteriophage phi6 to intensified genetic drift in small populations and caused viral fitness to decline through the accumulation of a deleterious mutation. We then propagated the mutated virus at a range of larger population sizes and allowed fitness to recover by natural selection. Although fitness declined in one large step, it was usually recovered in smaller steps. More importantly, step size during recovery was smaller with decreasing size of the recovery population. These results confirm Fisher's main prediction that advantageous mutations of small effect should be more common. We also show that the advantageous mutations of small effect are compensatory mutations whose advantage is conditional (epistatic) on the presence of the deleterious mutation, in which case the adaptive landscape of phi6 is likely to be very rugged.},

We found heterogeneity of evolutionary mechanisms between the different subtypes with a category of amino acid sites observed that had undergone positive selection for subtypes C, F1, and G, while these sites had undergone purifying selection in all other subtypes. Also, amino acid sites within subtypes A and K that had undergone purifying selection were observed, while these sites had undergone positive selection in all other subtypes.

As the changes in neutral allele frequencies when hitchhiking are rapid, diffusion theory is not appropriate for studying neutral dynamics. A stationary distribution and some results on substitution processes are presented that use the theory of continuous-time Markov processes with discontinuous sample paths. The coalescent of the pseudohitchhiking model is shown to have a random number of branches at each node, which leads to a frequency spectrum that is different from that of the equilibrium neutral model. If genetic draft, the name given to these induced stochastic effects, is a more important stochastic force than genetic drift, then a number of paradoxes that have plagued population genetics disappear.},

abstract = {Relatively little is known about the importance of amino acid interactions in protein and phenotypic evolution. Here we examine whether mutations that are pathogenic in Drosophila melanogaster become fixed via epistasis in other Dipteran genomes. Overall divergence at pathogenic amino acid sites is reduced. However, approximately 10% of the substitutions at these sites carry the exact same pathogenic amino acid found in D. melanogaster mutants. Hence compensatory mutation(s) must have evolved. Surprisingly, the fraction 10% is not affected by phylogenetic distance. These results support a selection-driven process that allows compensated amino acid substitutions to become rapidly fixed in taxa with large populations.},

title = {Dynamic correlation between intrahost HIV-1 quasispecies evolution and disease progression},
abstract = {Quantifying the dynamics of intrahost HIV-1 sequence evolution is one means of uncovering information about the interaction between HIV-1 and the host immune system. In the chronic phase of infection, common dynamics of sequence divergence and diversity have been reported. We developed an HIV-1 sequence evolution model that simulated the effects of mutation and fitness of sequence variants. The amount of evolution was described by the distance from the founder strain, and fitness was described by the number of offspring a parent sequence produces. Analysis of the model suggested that the previously observed saturation of divergence and decrease of diversity in later stages of infection can be explained by a decrease in the proportion of offspring that are mutants as the distance from the founder strain increases rather than due to an increase of viral fitness. The prediction of the model was examined by performing phylogenetic analysis to estimate the change in the rate of evolution during infection. In agreement with our modeling, in 13 out of 15 patients (followed for 3-12 years) we found that the rate of intrahost HIV-1 evolution was not constant but rather slowed down at a rate correlated with the rate of CD4+ T-cell decline. The correlation between the dynamics of the evolutionary rate and the rate of CD4+ T-cell decline, coupled with our HIV-1 sequence evolution model, explains previously conflicting observations of the relationships between the rate of HIV-1 quasispecies evolution and disease progression.},

title = {Physiological sex predicts hybrid sterility regardless of genotype},
abstract = {Reproductive isolation between biological species is characterized by Haldane's rule, which states that the heterogametic sex (XY or ZW) suffers the most dysfunctional effects of hybridization. It has been hypothesized that, in addition to X-linked recessive genes, Haldane's rule also reflects the faster evolution of genes related to male reproduction (faster-male evolution). We used sex-reversed hybrid Xenopus to test faster-male evolution by examining the fertility of sex-reversed individuals with the genotype of the inverse phenotypic sex. Hybrid males are sterile and hybrid females are fertile irrespective of their genotypic sex. Gene expression profiles match these adult phenotypes, and our results demonstrate that faster-male evolution is the most likely mechanism producing hybrid male sterility.},

title = {Test of Interaction Between Genetic Markers That Affect Fitness in Aspergillus niger},
abstract = {In this paper we study whether and how a number of arbitrarily chosen marker mutations interact in their effect on fitness, which is relevant for our understanding of the evolution of sex. If epistasis is synergistic, the main function of sex may be to facilitate selection against deleterious mutations. We use strains of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger with variable combinations of marker mutations that have been obtained by isolating segregants from a diploid between a wild-type strain and a related strain carrying a marker mutation on each of its eight chromosomes. The marker mutations include five auxotrophic and two resistance mutations. As a measure of fitness the mycelium growth rate on supplemented medium has been used. The results suggest that the marker mutations have independent effects on fitness, and hence they do not support the deterministic mutation hypothesis of the evolution of sex. The apparent linear relationship between mutation number and log fitness is the result of interactions of opposite type (i.e., synergistic and antagonistic) that cancel each other's effect. However, due to an isolation bias caused by the fact that not all possible strains with many mutations could be isolated, the results may be relatively biased towards an antagonistic relationship between mutation number and log fitness.},

abstract = {In embryonic stem (ES) cells, bivalent chromatin domains with overlapping repressive (H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation) and activating (H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation) histone modifications mark the promoters of more than 2,000 genes. To gain insight into the structure and function of bivalent domains, we mapped key histone modifications and subunits of Polycomb-repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) genomewide in human and mouse ES cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation, followed by ultra high-throughput sequencing. We find that bivalent domains can be segregated into two classes -- the first occupied by both PRC2 and PRC1 (PRC1-positive) and the second specifically bound by PRC2 (PRC2-only). PRC1-positive bivalent domains appear functionally distinct as they more efficiently retain lysine 27 tri-methylation upon differentiation, show stringent conservation of chromatin state, and associate with an overwhelming number of developmental regulator gene promoters. We also used computational genomics to search for sequence determinants of Polycomb binding. This analysis revealed that the genomewide locations of PRC2 and PRC1 can be largely predicted from the locations, sizes, and underlying motif contents of CpG islands. We propose that large CpG islands depleted of activating motifs confer epigenetic memory by recruiting the full repertoire of Polycomb complexes in pluripotent cells.},

title = {Viral dynamics in hepatitis B virus infection},
abstract = {Treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections with the reverse transcriptase inhibitor lamivudine leads to a rapid decline in plasma viremia and provides estimates for crucial kinetic constants of HBV replication. We find that in persistently infected patients, HBV particles are cleared from the plasma with a half-life of approximately 1.0 day, which implies a 50% daily turnover of the free virus population. Total viral release into the periphery is approximately 10(11) virus particles per day. Although we have no direct measurement of the infected cell mass, we can estimate the turnover rate of these cells in two ways: (i) by comparing the rate of viral production before and after therapy or (ii) from the decline of hepatitis B antigen during treatment. These two independent methods give equivalent results: we find a wide distribution of half-lives for virus-producing cells, ranging from 10 to 100 days in different patients, which may reflect differences in rates of lysis of infected cells by immune responses. Our analysis provides a quantitative understanding of HBV replication dynamics in vivo and has implications for the optimal timing of drug treatment and immunotherapy in chronic HBV infection. This study also represents a comparison for recent findings on the dynamics of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The total daily production of plasma virus is, on average, higher in chronic HBV carriers than in HIV-infected patients, but the half-life of virus-producing cells is much shorter in HIV. Most strikingly, there is no indication of drug resistance in HBV-infected patients treated for up to 24 weeks.},

By reconstructing the genealogy of an individual from the population evolution, we measure the distribution of ancestors appearing more than once in a given tree. After a transient time, the probability of repetition follows, up to a rescaling, a stationary distribution which we calculate both numerically and analytically. This distribution exhibits a universal shape with a nontrivial power law which can be understood by an exact, though simple, renormalization calculation. Some real data on human genealogy illustrate the problem, which is relevant to the study of the real degree of diversity in closed interbreeding communities.},

title = {Hepatitis C virus F protein sequence reveals a lack of functional constraints and a variable pattern of amino acid substitution},
abstract = {Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an important human pathogen that affects 170 million people worldwide. The HCV genome is an RNA molecule that is approximately 9.6 kb in length and encodes a polyprotein that is cleaved proteolytically to generate at least 10 mature viral proteins. Recently, a new HCV protein named F has been described, which is synthesized as a result of a ribosomal frameshift. Little is known about the biological properties of this protein, but the possibility that the F protein may participate in HCV morphology or replication has been raised. In this work, the presence of functional constraints in the F protein was investigated. It was found that the rate of amino acid substitutions along the F protein was significantly higher than the rate of synonymous substitutions, and comparisons involving genes that represented independent phylogenetic lineages yielded very different divergence/conservation patterns. The distribution of stop codons in the F protein across all HCV genotypes was also investigated; genotypes 2 and 3 were found to have more stop codons than genotype 1. The results of this work suggest strongly that the pattern of divergence in the F protein is not affected by functional constraints.},

title = {How can the low levels of DNA sequence variation in regions of the drosophila genome with low recombination rates be explained?},
abstract = {Different regions of the Drosophila genome have very different rates of recombination. For example, near centromeres and near the tips of chromosomes, the rates of recombination are much lower than in other regions. Several surveys of polymorphisms in Drosophila have now documented that levels of DNA polymorphism are positively correlated with rates of recombination; i.e., regions with low rates of recombination tend to have low levels of DNA polymorphism within populations of Drosophila. Three hypotheses are reviewed that might account for these observations. The first hypothesis is that regions of low recombination have low neutral mutation rates. Under this hypothesis between-species divergences should also be low in regions of low recombination. In fact, regions of low recombination have diverged at the same rate as other regions of the genome. On this basis, this strictly neutral hypothesis is rejected. The second hypothesis is that the process of fixation of favorable mutations leads to the observed correlation between polymorphism and recombination. This occurs via genetic hitchhiking, in which linked regions of the genome are swept along with the selectively favored mutant as it increases in frequency and eventually fixes in the population. This hitchhiking model with fixation of favorable mutations is compatible with major features of the data. By assuming this model is correct, one can estimate the rate of fixation of favorable mutations. The third hypothesis is that selection against continually arising deleterious mutations results in reduced levels of polymorphism at linked loci. Analysis of this background selection model shows that it can produce some reduction in levels of polymorphism but cannot explain some extreme cases that have been observed. Thus, it appears that hitchhiking of favorable mutations and background selection against deleterious mutations must be considered together to correctly account for the patterns of polymorphism that are observed in Drosophila.},

title = {Population, evolutionary and genomic consequences of interference selection},
abstract = {Weakly selected mutations are most likely to be physically clustered across genomes and, when sufficiently linked, they alter each others' fixation probability, a process we call interference selection (IS). Here we study population genetics and evolutionary consequences of IS on the selected mutations themselves and on adjacent selectively neutral variation. We show that IS reduces levels of polymorphism and increases low-frequency variants and linkage disequilibrium, in both selected and adjacent neutral mutations. IS can account for several well-documented patterns of variation and composition in genomic regions with low rates of crossing over in Drosophila. IS cannot be described simply as a reduction in the efficacy of selection and effective population size in standard models of selection and drift. Rather, IS can be better understood with models that incorporate a constant "traffic" of competing alleles. Our simulations also allow us to make genome-wide predictions that are specific to IS. We show that IS will be more severe at sites in the center of a region containing weakly selected mutations than at sites located close to the edge of the region. Drosophila melanogaster genomic data strongly support this prediction, with genes without introns showing significantly reduced codon bias in the center of coding regions. As expected, if introns relieve IS, genes with centrally located introns do not show reduced codon bias in the center of the coding region. We also show that reasonably small differences in the length of intermediate "neutral" sequences embedded in a region under selection increase the effectiveness of selection on the adjacent selected sequences. Hence, the presence and length of sequences such as introns or intergenic regions can be a trait subject to selection in recombining genomes. In support of this prediction, intron presence is positively correlated with a gene's codon bias in D. melanogaster. Finally, the study of temporal dynamics of IS after a change of recombination rate shows that nonequilibrium codon usage may be the norm rather than the exception.},

abstract = {Classical studies show that for many proteins, the information required for specifying the tertiary structure is contained in the amino acid sequence. Here, we attempt to define the sequence rules for specifying a protein fold by computationally creating artificial protein sequences using only statistical information encoded in a multiple sequence alignment and no tertiary structure information. Experimental testing of libraries of artificial WW domain sequences shows that a simple statistical energy function capturing coevolution between amino acid residues is necessary and sufficient to specify sequences that fold into native structures. The artificial proteins show thermodynamic stabilities similar to natural WW domains, and structure determination of one artificial protein shows excellent agreement with the WW fold at atomic resolution. The relative simplicity of the information used for creating sequences suggests a marked reduction to the potential complexity of the protein-folding problem.},

title = {Linkage disequilibrium in the human genome},
abstract = {With the availability of a dense genome-wide map of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), a central issue in human genetics is whether it is now possible to use linkage disequilibrium (LD) to map genes that cause disease. LD refers to correlations among neighbouring alleles, reflecting 'haplotypes' descended from single, ancestral chromosomes. The size of LD blocks has been the subject of considerable debate. Computer simulations and empirical data have suggested that LD extends only a few kilobases (kb) around common SNPs, whereas other data have suggested that it can extend much further, in some cases greater than 100 kb. It has been difficult to obtain a systematic picture of LD because past studies have been based on only a few (1-3) loci and different populations. Here, we report a large-scale experiment using a uniform protocol to examine 19 randomly selected genomic regions. LD in a United States population of north-European descent typically extends 60 kb from common alleles, implying that LD mapping is likely to be practical in this population. By contrast, LD in a Nigerian population extends markedly less far. The results illuminate human history, suggesting that LD in northern Europeans is shaped by a marked demographic event about 27,000-53,000 years ago.},

title = {Antibody-protein interactions: benchmark datasets and prediction tools evaluation},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ability to predict antibody binding sites (aka antigenic determinants or B-cell epitopes) for a given protein is a precursor to new vaccine design and diagnostics. Among the various methods of B-cell epitope identification X-ray crystallography is one of the most reliable methods. Using these experimental data computational methods exist for B-cell epitope prediction. As the number of structures of antibody-protein complexes grows, further interest in prediction methods using 3D structure is anticipated. This work aims to establish a benchmark for 3D structure-based epitope prediction methods. RESULTS: Two B-cell epitope benchmark datasets inferred from the 3D structures of antibody-protein complexes were defined. The first is a dataset of 62 representative 3D structures of protein antigens with inferred structural epitopes. The second is a dataset of 82 structures of antibody-protein complexes containing different structural epitopes. Using these datasets, eight web-servers developed for antibody and protein binding sites prediction have been evaluated. In no method did performance exceed a 40% precision and 46% recall. The values of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the evaluated methods were about 0.6 for ConSurf, DiscoTope, and PPI-PRED methods and above 0.65 but not exceeding 0.70 for protein-protein docking methods when the best of the top ten models for the bound docking were considered; the remaining methods performed close to random. The benchmark datasets are included as a supplement to this paper. CONCLUSION: It may be possible to improve epitope prediction methods through training on datasets which include only immune epitopes and through utilizing more features characterizing epitopes, for example, the evolutionary conservation score. Notwithstanding, overall poor performance may reflect the generality of antigenicity and hence the inability to decipher B-cell epitopes as an intrinsic feature of the protein. It is an open question as to whether ultimately discriminatory features can be found.},

Our model alternates selection according to Lotka-Volterra-type competition equations, with reproduction using the ideas of quantitative genetics. The recurrence relations defined by these equations are studied numerically and analytically. We find that when a population enters a new environment, with a broad distribution of unexploited food sources, the population distribution broadens under a variety of conditions, with peaks at the edge of the distribution indicating the formation of subpopulations. After a long enough time period, the population can split into several subpopulations with little gene flow between them.},

Here we present strategies to visualize synaptic circuits by genetically labelling neurons with multiple, distinct colours. In Brainbow transgenes, Cre/lox recombination is used to create a stochastic choice of expression between three or more fluorescent proteins (XFPs). Integration of tandem Brainbow copies in transgenic mice yielded combinatorial XFP expression, and thus many colours, thereby providing a way to distinguish adjacent neurons and visualize other cellular interactions. As a demonstration, we reconstructed hundreds of neighbouring axons and multiple synaptic contacts in one small volume of a cerebellar lobe exhibiting approximately 90 colours. The expression in some lines also allowed us to map glial territories and follow glial cells and neurons over time in vivo. The ability of the Brainbow system to label uniquely many individual cells within a population may facilitate the analysis of neuronal circuitry on a large scale.},

title = {Waiting with and without recombination: the time to production of a double mutant},
abstract = {R.A. Fisher and H.J. Muller argued in the 1930s that a major evolutionary advantage of recombination is that it allows favorable mutations to be combined within an individual even when they first appear in different individuals. This effect is evaluated in a two-locus, two-allele model by calculating the average waiting time until a new genotypic combination first appears in a haploid population. Three approximations are developed and compared with Monte Carlo simulations of the Wright-Fisher process of random genetic drift in a finite population. First, a crude method, based on the deterministic accumulation of single mutants, produces a waiting time of 1/square root of N mu(2) with no recombination and [formula: see text] with recombination between the two loci, where mu is the mutation rate, N is the haploid population size, and R is the recombination rate. Second, the waiting time is calculated as the expected value of a heterogeneous geometric distribution obtained from a branching process approximation. This gives accurate estimates for small values of N mu large. The estimates for small values of N mu are considerably lower than the simulated values. Finally, diffusion analysis of the Wright-Fisher process provides accurate estimates for N mu small, and the time scales of the diffusion process show a difference between R = 0 and for R >> 0 of the same order of magnitude as seen in the deterministic analysis. In the absence of recombination, accurate approximations to the waiting time are obtained by using the branching process for high N mu and the diffusion approximation for low N mu. For low N mu the waiting time is well approximated by 1/the square root of 8N2 mu(3). With R >> 0, the following dependence on N mu is observed: For N mu > 1 the waiting time is virtually independent of recombination and is well described by the branching process approximation. For N mu approximately equal to 1 the waiting time is well described by a simplified diffusion approximation that assumes symmetry in the frequencies of single mutants. For N mu << 1 the waiting time is well described by the diffusion approximation allowing asymmetry in the frequencies of single mutants. Recombination lowers the waiting time until a new genotypic combination first appears, but the effect is small compared to that of the mutation rate and population size. For large N mu, recombination has a negligible effect, and its effect is strongest for small N mu, in which case the waiting time approaches a fixed fraction of the waiting time for R = 0. Free recombination lowers the waiting time to about 45% of the waiting time for absolute linkage for small N mu. Selection has little effect on the importance of recombination in general.},

abstract = {Spontaneous mutations were accumulated for approximately 4800 generations in 48 lines of yeast protected from effective selection by frequent passage through single-cell bottlenecks. Changes in fitness were evaluated by direct competition with matched parental stocks differing only at a selectively neutral marker locus. Average fitness declined by approximately 5% over the course of the experiment. The rate of change increased sharply in later generations, strongly suggesting synergistic epistasis. Divergence among lines increased rapidly relative to the change in average fitness and also at an accelerating pace. Both results are well matched by a model assuming that fitness cost increases exponentially (approximately second order) with the number of accumulated mutations. This result is consistent with fitness loss due primarily to interactions between specific pairs of gene products. I also estimate that approximately 25% of the mutations with detectable fitness effects were beneficial. This result can be explained by the fact that the effects of most mutations are small relative to the distance from a local fitness optimum.},

title = {Haldane's sieve and adaptation from the standing genetic variation},
abstract = {We consider populations that adapt to a sudden environmental change by fixing alleles found at mutation-selection balance. In particular, we calculate probabilities of fixation for previously deleterious alleles, ignoring the input of new mutations. We find that "Haldane's sieve"--the bias against the establishment of recessive beneficial mutations--does not hold under these conditions. Instead probabilities of fixation are generally independent of dominance. We show that this result is robust to patterns of sex expression for both X-linked and autosomal loci. We further show that adaptive evolution is invariably slower at X-linked than autosomal loci when evolution begins from mutation-selection balance. This result differs from that obtained when adaptation uses new mutations, a finding that may have some bearing on recent attempts to distinguish between hitchhiking and background selection by contrasting the molecular population genetics of X-linked vs. autosomal loci. Last, we suggest a test to determine whether adaptation used new mutations or previously deleterious alleles from the standing genetic variation.},

title = {Analysis of combinatorial cis-regulation in synthetic and genomic promoters},
abstract = {Transcription factor binding sites are being discovered at a rapid pace. It is now necessary to turn attention towards understanding how these sites work in combination to influence gene expression. Quantitative models that accurately predict gene expression from promoter sequence will be a crucial part of solving this problem. Here we present such a model, based on the analysis of synthetic promoter libraries in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Thermodynamic models based only on the equilibrium binding of transcription factors to DNA and to each other captured a large fraction of the variation in expression in every library. Thermodynamic analysis of these libraries uncovered several phenomena in our system, including cooperativity and the effects of weak binding sites. When applied to the S. cerevisiae genome, a model of repression by Mig1 (which was trained on synthetic promoters) predicts a number of Mig1-regulated genes that lack significant Mig1-binding sites in their promoters. The success of the thermodynamic approach suggests that the information encoded by combinations of cis-regulatory sites is interpreted primarily through simple protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, with complicated biochemical reactions-such as nucleosome modifications-being downstream events. Quantitative analyses of synthetic promoter libraries will be an important tool in unravelling the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation.},

title = {Blind Decomposition of Spectral Imaging Microscopy: A Study on Artificial and Real Test Data},
abstract = {Recently, we have proposed a blind source separation algorithm to separate dyes in multiply labeled fluorescence microscopy images. Applying the algorithm, we are able to successfully extract the dye distributions from the images. It thereby solves an often challenging problem since the recorded emission spectra of fluorescent dyes are environment and instrument specific. The separation algorithm is based on nonnegative matrix factorization in a Poisson noise model and works well on many samples. In some cases, however, additional cost function terms such as sparseness enhancement are necessary to arrive at a satisfactory decomposition.
In this contribution we analyze the algorithm on two very well controlled real data sets. In the first case, known sources are artificially mixed in varying mixing conditions. In the second case, fluorescent beads are used to generate well behaved mixing situations. In both cases we can successfully extract the original sources. We discuss how the separation is influenced by the weight of the additional cost function terms, thereby illustrating that BSS can be be vastly improved by invoking qualitative knowledge about the nature of the sources},

title = {Effects of genetic drift on variance components under a general model of epistasis},
abstract = {We analyze the changes in the mean and variance components of a quantitative trait caused by changes in allele frequencies, concentrating on the effects of genetic drift. We use a general representation of epistasis and dominance that allows an arbitrary relation between genotype and phenotype for any number of diallelic loci. We assume initial and final Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium in our analyses of drift-induced changes. Random drift generates transient linkage disequilibria that cause correlations between allele frequency fluctuations at different loci. However, we show that these have negligible effects, at least for interactions among small numbers of loci. Our analyses are based on diffusion approximations that summarize the effects of drift in terms of F, the inbreeding coefficient, interpreted as the expected proportional decrease in heterozygosity at each locus. For haploids, the variance of the trait mean after a population bottleneck is var(Delta(z) over bar) = Sigma(k)(=1)(n) (FVA(k))-V-k, where n is the number of loci contributing to the trait variance, V-A(1) = V-A is the additive genetic variance, and V-A(k) is the kth-order additive epistatic variance. The expected additive genetic variance after the bottleneck, denoted <V-A(*)> is closely related to var(Delta(z) over bar); <V-A(*)> = (1 - F) Sigma(k)(=1)(n) kF(k-1) V-A(k). Thus, epistasis inflates the expected additive variance above V-A(1 - F), the expectation under additivity. For haploids (and diploids without dominance), the expected value of every variance component is inflated by the existence of higher order interactions (e.g., third-order epistasis inflates <V-AA(*)>). This is not true in general with diploidy, because dominance alone can reduce <VA(*)> below V-A(1 - F) (e.g., when dominant alleles are rare). Without A dominance, diploidy produces simple expressions: var(Delta(z) over bar) = Sigma(k)(=1)(n) (2F)(k) V-k(A(k)) and <V-A(*)> = (1 - F) Sigma(k)(=1)(n) k(2F)V-k-1(A(k).) k With dominance (and even without epistasis), var(Delta(z) over bar) and no longer depend solely on the variance components in the base population. For small F, the expected additive variance simplifies to <V-A(*)> similar or equal to (1 - F)V-A +4FV(AA) + 2FV(D) + 2FC(AD), where C-AD is a sum of two terms describing covariances between additive effects and dominance and additive X dominance interactions. Whether population bottlenecks lead to expected increases in additive variance depends primarily on the ratio of nonadditive to additive genetic variance in the base population, but dominance precludes simple predictions based solely on variance components. We illustrate these results using a model in which genotypic values are drawn at random, allowing extreme and erratic epistatic interactions. Although our analyses clarify the conditions under which drift is expected to increase V-A, we question the evolutionary importance of such increases.},

abstract = {Ionizing radiation is an established source of chromosome aberrations (CAs). Although double-strand breaks (DSBs) are implicated in radiation-induced and other CAs, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that, although the vast majority of randomly induced DSBs in G(2) diploid yeast cells are repaired efficiently through homologous recombination (HR) between sister chromatids or homologous chromosomes, approximately 2% of all DSBs give rise to CAs. Complete molecular analysis of the genome revealed that nearly all of the CAs resulted from HR between nonallelic repetitive elements, primarily Ty retrotransposons. Nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) accounted for few, if any, of the CAs. We conclude that only those DSBs that fall at the 3-5% of the genome composed of repetitive DNA elements are efficient at generating rearrangements with dispersed small repeats across the genome, whereas DSBs in unique sequences are confined to recombinational repair between the large regions of homology contained in sister chromatids or homologous chromosomes. Because repeat-associated DSBs can efficiently lead to CAs and reshape the genome, they could be a rich source of evolutionary change.},

abstract = {It is commonly believed that influenza epidemics arise through the incremental accumulation of viral mutations, culminating in a novel antigenic type that is able to escape host immunity. Successive epidemic strains therefore become increasingly antigenically distant from a founding strain. Here, we present an alternative explanation where, because of functional constraints on the defining epitopes, the virus population is characterized by a limited set of antigenic types, all of which may be continuously generated by mutation from preexisting strains and other processes. Under these circumstances, influenza outbreaks arise as a consequence of host immune selection in a manner that is independent of the mode and tempo of viral mutation. By contrast with existing paradigms, antigenic distance between epidemic strains does not necessarily accumulate with time in our model, and it is the changing profile of host population immunity that creates the conditions for the emergence of the next influenza strain rather than the mutational capabilities of the virus.},

title = {Assessing current adaptation and phylogenetic inertia as explanations of trait evolution: The need for controlled comparisons},
abstract = {The determination of whether the pattern of trait evolution observed in a comparative analysis of species data is due to adaptation to current environments, to phylogenetic inertia, or to both of these forces requires that one control for the effects of either force when making an assessment of the evolutionary role of the other. Orzack and Sober (2001) developed the method of controlled comparisons to make such assessments; their implementation of the method focussed on a discretely varying trait. Here, we show that the method of controlled comparisons can be viewed as a meta-method, which can be implemented in many ways. We discuss which recent methods for the comparative analysis of continuously distributed traits can generate controlled comparisons and can thereby be used to properly assess whether current adaptation and/or phylogenetic inertia have influenced a trait's evolution. The implementation of controlled comparisons is illustrated by an analysis of sex-ratio data for fig wasps. This analysis suggests that current adaptation and phylogenetic inertia influence this trait.},

The precise knowledge of percolation thresholds is thus of paramount importance. For two dimensional lattice graphs, we use the universal scaling form of the cluster size distributions to derive a relation between the mean Euler characteristic of the critical percolation patterns and the threshold density {\$}p_c{\$}. From this relation, we deduce a simple rule to estimate {\$}p_c{\$}, which is remarkably accurate. We present some evidence that similar relations might hold for continuum percolation and percolation in higher dimensions. },

title = {A new theory of MHC evolution: beyond selection on the immune genes},
abstract = {The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a dense region of immune genes with high levels of polymorphism, which are arranged in haplotype blocks. Traditional models of balancing selection (i.e. overdominance and negative frequency dependence) were developed to study the population genetics of single genes. However, the MHC is a multigene family surrounded by linked (non-neutral) polymorphisms, and not all of its features are well explained by these models. For example, (i) the high levels of polymorphism in small populations, (ii) the unexpectedly large genetic differentiation between populations, (iii) the shape of the allelic genealogy associated with trans-species evolution, and (iv) the close associations between particular MHC (human leucocyte antigen, HLA) haplotypes and the approximately 100 pathologies in humans. Here, I propose a new model of MHC evolution named Associative Balancing Complex evolution that can explain these phenomena. The model proposes that recessive deleterious mutations accumulate as a 'sheltered load' nearby MHC genes. These mutations can accumulate because (i) they are rarely expressed as homozygotes given the high MHC gene diversity and (ii) purifying selection is inefficient with low recombination rates (cf. Muller's ratchet). Once fixed, these mutations add to balancing selection and further reinforce linkage through epistatic selection against recombinants.},

title = {Toolbox model of evolution of prokaryotic metabolic networks and their regulation},
abstract = {It has been reported that the number of transcription factors encoded in prokaryotic genomes scales approximately quadratically with their total number of genes. We propose a conceptual explanation of this finding and illustrate it using a simple model in which metabolic and regulatory networks of prokaryotes are shaped by horizontal gene transfer of coregulated metabolic pathways. Adapting to a new environmental condition monitored by a new transcription factor (e.g., learning to use another nutrient) involves both acquiring new enzymes and reusing some of the enzymes already encoded in the genome. As the repertoire of enzymes of an organism (its toolbox) grows larger, it can reuse its enzyme tools more often and thus needs to get fewer new ones to master each new task. From this observation, it logically follows that the number of functional tasks and their regulators increases faster than linearly with the total number of genes encoding enzymes. Genomes can also shrink, e.g., because of a loss of a nutrient from the environment, followed by deletion of its regulator and all enzymes that become redundant. We propose several simple models of network evolution elaborating on this toolbox argument and reproducing the empirically observed quadratic scaling. The distribution of lengths of pathway branches in our model agrees with that of the real-life metabolic network of Escherichia coli. Thus, our model provides a qualitative explanation for broad distributions of regulon sizes in prokaryotes.},

abstract = { The relationship between the shape of a fitness landscape and the underlying gene interactions, or epistasis, has been extensively studied in the two-locus case. Gene interactions among multiple loci are usually reduced to two-way interactions. We present a geometric theory of shapes of fitness landscapes for multiple loci. A central concept is the genotope, which is the convex hull of all possible allele frequencies in populations. Triangulations of the genotope correspond to different shapes of fitness landscapes and reveal all the gene interactions. The theory is applied to fitness data from HIV and Drosophila melanogaster. In both cases, our findings refine earlier analyses and reveal previously undetected gene interactions. },

abstract = {Environmental changes have caused episodes of habitat expansions in the evolutionary history of many species. These range changes affect the dynamics of biological evolution in multiple ways. Recent microbial experiments as well as simulations suggest that enhanced genetic drift at the frontier of a two-dimensional range expansion can cause genetic sectoring patterns with fractal domain boundaries. Here, we propose and analyze a simple model of asexual biological evolution at expanding frontiers that explains these neutral patterns and predicts the effect of natural selection. We find that beneficial mutations give rise to sectors with an opening angle that depends sensitively on the selective advantage of the mutants. Deleterious mutations, on the other hand, are not able to establish a sector permanently. They can, however, temporarily "surf" on the population front, and thereby reach unusually high frequencies. As a consequence, expanding frontiers are loaded with a high fraction of mutants at mutation-selection balance. Numerically, we also determine the condition at which the wild type is lost in favor of deleterious mutants (genetic meltdown) at a growing front. Our prediction for this error threshold differs qualitatively from existing well-mixed theories, and sets tight constraints on sustainable mutation rates for populations that undergo frequent range expansions.},

abstract = {Structural data led to the proposal that the molecular motor myosin moves actin by a swinging of the light chain binding domain, or "neck." To test the hypothesis that the neck functions as a mechanical lever, smooth muscle heavy meromyosin (HMM) mutants were expressed with shorter or longer necks by either deleting or adding light chain binding sites. The mutant HMMs were characterized kinetically and mechanically, with emphasis on measurements of unitary displacements and forces in the laser trap assay. Two shorter necked constructs had smaller unitary step sizes and moved actin more slowly than WT HMM in the motility assay. A longer necked construct that contained an additional essential light chain binding site exhibited a 1.4-fold increase in the unitary step size compared with its control. Kinetic changes were also observed with several of the constructs. The mutant lacking a neck produced force at a somewhat reduced level, while the force exerted by the giraffe construct was higher than control. The single molecule displacement and force data support the hypothesis that the neck functions as a rigid lever, with the fulcrum for movement and force located at a point within the motor domain.},

title = {Mutation Master: profiles of substitutions in hepatitis C virus RNA of the core, alternate reading frame, and NS2 coding regions},
abstract = {The RNA genome of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) undergoes rapid evolutionary change. Efforts to control this virus would benefit from the advent of facile methods to identify characteristic features of HCV RNA and proteins, and to condense the vast amount of mutational data into a readily interpretable form. Many HCV sequences are available in GenBank. To facilitate analysis, consensus sequences were constructed to eliminate the overrepresentation of certain genotypes, such as genotype 1, and a novel package of sequence analysis tools was developed. Mutation Master generates profiles of point mutations in a population of sequences and produces a set of visual displays and tables indicating the number, frequency, and character of substitutions. It can be used to analyze hundreds of sequences at a time. When applied to 255 HCV core protein sequences, Mutation Master identified variable domains and a series of mutations meriting further investigation. It flagged position 4, for example, where 90% or more of all sequences in genotypes 1, 2, 4, and 5, have N4, whereas those in genotypes 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 have L4. This pattern is noteworthy: L (hydrophobic) to N (polar) substitutions are generally rare, and genotypes 1, 2, 4, and 5 do not form a recognized super family of sequences. Thus, the L4N substitution probably arose independently several times. Moreover, not one member of genotypes 1, 2, 4, or 5 has L4 and not one member of genotypes 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 has N4. This nonoverlapping pattern suggests that coordinated changes at position 4 and a second site are required to yield a viable virus. The package generated a table of genotype-specific substitutions whose future analysis may help to identify interacting amino acids. Three substitutions were present in 100% of genotype 2 members and absent from all others: A68D, R74K, and R114H. Finally, this study revealed thatARFP, a novel protein encoded in an overlapping reading frame, is as conserved as conventional HCV proteins, a result supporting a role for ARFP in the viral life cycle. Whereas most conventional programs for phylogenetic analysis of sequences provide information about overall relatedness of genes or genomes, this program highlights and profiles point mutations. This is important because determinants of pathogenicity and drug susceptibility are likely to result from changes at only one or two key nucleotides or amino acid sites, and would not be detected by the type of pairwise comparisons that have usually been performed on HCV to date.

title = {An equivalence principle for the incorporation of favorable mutations in asexual populations},
abstract = {Rapid evolution of asexual populations, such as that of cancer cells or of microorganisms developing drug resistance, can include the simultaneous spread of distinct beneficial mutations. We demonstrate that evolution in such cases is driven by the fitness effects and appearance times of only a small minority of favorable mutations. The complexity of the mutation-selection process is thereby greatly reduced, and much of the evolutionary dynamics can be encapsulated in two parameters-an effective selection coefficient and effective rate of beneficial mutations. We confirm this theoretical finding and estimate the effective parameters for evolving populations of fluorescently labeled Escherichia coli. The effective parameters constitute a simple description and provide a natural standard for comparing adaptation between species and across environments.},

abstract = {Strikingly consistent correlations between rates of coding-sequence evolution and gene expression levels are apparent across taxa, but the biological causes behind the selective pressures on coding-sequence evolution remain controversial. Here, we demonstrate conserved patterns of simple covariation between sequence evolution, codon usage, and mRNA level in E. coli, yeast, worm, fly, mouse, and human that suggest that all observed trends stem largely from a unified underlying selective pressure. In metazoans, these trends are strongest in tissues composed of neurons, whose structure and lifetime confer extreme sensitivity to protein misfolding. We propose, and demonstrate using a molecular-level evolutionary simulation, that selection against toxicity of misfolded proteins generated by ribosome errors suffices to create all of the observed covariation. The mechanistic model of molecular evolution that emerges yields testable biochemical predictions, calls into question the use of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution ratios (Ka/Ks) to detect functional selection, and suggests how mistranslation may contribute to neurodegenerative disease.},

Through systematic tagging of open reading frames (ORFs), the majority of complexes were purified several times, suggesting screen saturation. The richness of the data set enabled a de novo characterization of the composition and organization of the cellular machinery. The ensemble of cellular proteins partitions into 491 complexes, of which 257 are novel, that differentially combine with additional attachment proteins or protein modules to enable a diversification of potential functions. Support for this modular organization of the proteome comes from integration with available data on expression, localization, function, evolutionary conservation, protein structure and binary interactions. This study provides the largest collection of physically determined eukaryotic cellular machines so far and a platform for biological data integration and modelling.},

title = {Role of minority populations of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in the evolution of viral resistance to protease inhibitors},
abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) drug resistance results from the accumulation of mutations in the viral genes targeted by the drugs. These genetic changes, however, are commonly detected and monitored by techniques that only take into account the dominant population of plasma virus. Because HIV-1-infected patients harbor a complex and diverse mixture of virus populations, the mechanisms underlying the emergence and the evolution of resistance are not fully elucidated. Using techniques that allow the quantification of resistance mutations in minority virus species, we have monitored the evolution of resistance in plasma virus populations from patients failing protease inhibitor treatment. Minority populations with distinct resistance genotypes were detected in all patients throughout the evolution of resistance. The emergence of new dominant genotypes followed two possible mechanisms: (i) emergence of a new mutation in a currently dominant genotype and (ii) emergence of a new genotype derived from a minority virus species. In most cases, these population changes were associated with an increase in resistance at the expense of a reduction in replication capacity. Our findings provide a preliminary indication that minority viral species, which evolve independently of the majority virus population, can eventually become dominant populations, thereby serving as a reservoir of diversity and possibly accelerating the development of drug resistance.},

title = {The structure of HIV-1 genomic RNA in the gp120 gene determines a recombination hot spot in vivo},
abstract = {By frequently rearranging large regions of the genome, genetic recombination is a major determinant in the plasticity of the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) population. In retroviruses, recombination mostly occurs by template switching during reverse transcription. The generation of retroviral vectors provides a means to study this process after a single cycle of infection of cells in culture. Using HIV-1-derived vectors, we present here the first characterization and estimate of the strength of a recombination hot spot in HIV-1 in vivo. In the hot spot region, located within the C2 portion of the gp120 envelope gene, the rate of recombination is up to ten times higher than in the surrounding regions. The hot region corresponds to a previously identified RNA hairpin structure. Although recombination breakpoints in vivo cluster in the top portion of the hairpin, the bias for template switching in this same region appears less marked in a cell-free system. By modulating the stability of this hairpin we were able to affect the local recombination rate both in vitro and in infected cells, indicating that the local folding of the genomic RNA is a major parameter in the recombination process. This characterization of reverse transcription products generated after a single cycle of infection provides insights in the understanding of the mechanism of recombination in vivo and suggests that specific regions of the genome might be prompted to yield different rates of evolution due to the presence of circumscribed recombination hot spots.},

We present a detailed review of the various structural rearrangements identified to date in humans, with particular reference to their influence on human phenotypic variation.

title = {Genetic progression and the waiting time to cancer},
abstract = {Cancer results from genetic alterations that disturb the normal cooperative behavior of cells. Recent high-throughput genomic studies of cancer cells have shown that the mutational landscape of cancer is complex and that individual cancers may evolve through mutations in as many as 20 different cancer-associated genes. We use data published by Sj{\"o}blom et al. (2006) to develop a new mathematical model for the somatic evolution of colorectal cancers. We employ the Wright-Fisher process for exploring the basic parameters of this evolutionary process and derive an analytical approximation for the expected waiting time to the cancer phenotype. Our results highlight the relative importance of selection over both the size of the cell population at risk and the mutation rate. The model predicts that the observed genetic diversity of cancer genomes can arise under a normal mutation rate if the average selective advantage per mutation is on the order of 1%. Increased mutation rates due to genetic instability would allow even smaller selective advantages during tumorigenesis. The complexity of cancer progression can be understood as the result of multiple sequential mutations, each of which has a relatively small but positive effect on net cell growth.},

Different existing concepts to obtain the rate are extended and compared to each other. The central role that is played by Kramers' stationary current carrying probability density is demonstrated. An improvement of this function by means of a perturbation theory allows one to calculate corrections to the rate by means fo the flux over population expression, the Rayleigh quotient and the mean first passage time to the stochastic separatrix. The Rayleigh quotient is in a sense superior as it allows one to obtain from the same stationary current carrying Kramers function higher order corrections than by means of other methods. Explicit results are obtained for the case of a cubic and a quartic potential and compared with existing results.},

One experimental approach to study epistasis is based on quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping using molecular markers. Comparisons can be made among all possible pair-wise combinations of the markers, irrespective of whether an additive QTL is associated with a marker; several software packages have been developed that facilitate this. We review several examples of using this approach to identify epistatic QTLs for traits of evolutionary or ecological interest. While there is variability in the results, the number of epistatic QTL interactions is often greater than or equal to the number of additive QTLs. The magnitude of epistatic effects can be larger than the additive effects. Thus, epistatic interactions seem to be an important part of natural genetic variation. Future studies of epistatic QTLs could lead to descriptions of the genetic networks underlying variation for fitness-related traits.},

title = {Stability and nuclear dynamics of the bicoid morphogen gradient},
abstract = {Patterning in multicellular organisms results from spatial gradients in morphogen concentration, but the dynamics of these gradients remain largely unexplored. We characterize, through in vivo optical imaging, the development and stability of the Bicoid morphogen gradient in Drosophila embryos that express a Bicoid-eGFP fusion protein. The gradient is established rapidly (approximately 1 hr after fertilization), with nuclear Bicoid concentration rising and falling during mitosis. Interphase levels result from a rapid equilibrium between Bicoid uptake and removal. Initial interphase concentration in nuclei in successive cycles is constant (+/-10%), demonstrating a form of gradient stability, but it subsequently decays by approximately 30%. Both direct photobleaching measurements and indirect estimates of Bicoid-eGFP diffusion constants (D < or = 1 microm(2)/s) provide a consistent picture of Bicoid transport on short ( approximately min) time scales but challenge traditional models of long-range gradient formation. A new model is presented emphasizing the possible role of nuclear dynamics in shaping and scaling the gradient.},

title = {Avoidance of protein fold disruption in natural virus recombinants},
abstract = {With the development of reliable recombination detection tools and an increasing number of available genome sequences, many studies have reported evidence of recombination in a wide range of virus genera. Recombination is apparently a major mechanism in virus evolution, allowing viruses to evolve more quickly by providing immediate direct access to many more areas of a sequence space than are accessible by mutation alone. Recombination has been widely described amongst the insect-transmitted plant viruses in the genus Begomovirus (family Geminiviridae), with potential recombination hot- and cold-spots also having been identified. Nevertheless, because very little is understood about either the biochemical predispositions of different genomic regions to recombine or what makes some recombinants more viable than others, the sources of the evolutionary and biochemical forces shaping distinctive recombination patterns observed in nature remain obscure. Here we present a detailed analysis of unique recombination events detectable in the DNA-A and DNA-A-like genome components of bipartite and monopartite begomoviruses. We demonstrate both that recombination breakpoint hot- and cold-spots are conserved between the two groups of viruses, and that patterns of sequence exchange amongst the genomes are obviously non-random. Using a computational technique designed to predict structural perturbations in chimaeric proteins, we demonstrate that observed recombination events tend to be less disruptive than sets of simulated ones. Purifying selection acting against natural recombinants expressing improperly folded chimaeric proteins is therefore a major determinant of natural recombination patterns in begomoviruses.},

title = {Information processing and signal integration in bacterial quorum  sensing},
abstract = { Bacteria communicate using secreted chemical signaling molecules called autoinducers in a process known as quorum sensing. The quorum-sensing network of the marine bacterium {\it Vibrio harveyi} employs three autoinducers, each known to encode distinct ecological information. Yet how cells integrate and interpret the information contained within the three autoinducer signals remains a mystery. Here, we develop a new framework for analyzing signal integration based on Information Theory and use it to analyze quorum sensing in {\it V. harveyi}. We quantify how much the cells can learn about individual autoinducers and explain the experimentally observed input-output relation of the {\it V. harveyi} quorum-sensing circuit. Our results suggest that the need to limit interference between input signals places strong constraints on the architecture of bacterial signal-integration networks, and that bacteria likely have evolved active strategies for minimizing this interference. Here we analyze two such strategies: manipulation of autoinducer production and feedback on receptor number ratios. },

Following an earlier heuristic argument in a letter by one of us, in the present paper we show rigorously its existence for a generic class of situations in physical and biological sciences. The local dynamical meaning of this potential function is demonstrated via a special stochastic differential equation and its global steady-state meaning via a novel and explicit form of the Fokker\{\&}ndash;Planck equation. We also give a procedure to obtain the special stochastic differential equation for any given Fokker\{\&}ndash;Planck equation. No detailed balance condition is required in our demonstration. For the first time we obtain here a formula to describe the noise-induced shift in drift force compared to the steady-state distribution, a phenomenon extensively observed in numerical studies.},

title = {HIV escape and attenuation by cytotoxic T lymphocytes},
abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Much of the current HIV-1 vaccine research focuses on harnessing the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte arm of the immune response. However, HIV-1 appears to have an unerring ability to evade cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses, through the process of escape mutation, and thus the potential benefit of a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-based vaccine remains uncertain. This review focuses on several recent studies that question whether escape mutation is always detrimental to the host, and may provide new hope for the success of a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-based vaccine against HIV. RECENT FINDINGS: Several recent studies, in both natural HIV-1 infection and the SIV model, have identified examples of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte escape mutants that revert on transmission to individuals lacking the selecting major histocompatibility complex alleles. The obvious implication of these data is that some cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses can only be evaded through escape mutations that actually reduce the replicative fitness of the virus. In addition, a recent vaccine study in macaques found that the control of immunodeficiency virus to undetectable levels was only achieved in animals that were able to force the virus to make such detrimental escape mutations. These data raise the intriguing possibility that, rather than undermining cytotoxic T-lymphocyte vaccines, escape mutation may be one of the keys to their success. SUMMARY: Clearly, not all escape mutations help to control viral replication. We discuss how these new data may assist in the struggle to develop a successful cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-based HIV vaccine, and what they tell us about the responses such a vaccine should aim to elicit.},

abstract = {Evolution by natural selection is a process of variation and selection acting on replicating units. These units are often assumed to be individuals, but in a sexual population, the largest reliably-replicated unit on which selection can act is a small section of chromosome -- hence, the `selfish gene' model. However, the scale of unit at which variation by spontaneous mutation occurs is different from the scale of unit at which variation by recombination occurs. I suggest that the action of recombinative variation and mutational variation together can enable local optimization to occur at two different scales simultaneously. I adapt a recent model illustrating a benefit of sexual recombination to illustrate conditions for two scales of optimization in natural populations, and show that the operation of natural selection in this scenario cannot be understood by considering either scale alone.},

abstract = {Positive selection can be inferred from its effect on linked neutral variation. In the restrictive case when there is no recombination, all linked variation is removed. If recombination is present but rare, both deterministic and stochastic models of positive selection show that linked variation hitchhikes to either low or high frequencies. While the frequency distribution of variation can be influenced by a number of evolutionary processes, an excess of derived variants at high frequency is a unique pattern produced by hitchhiking (derived refers to the nonancestral state as determined from an outgroup). We adopt a statistic, H, to measure an excess of high compared to intermediate frequency variants. Only a few high-frequency variants are needed to detect hitchhiking since not many are expected under neutrality. This is of particular utility in regions of low recombination where there is not much variation and in regions of normal or high recombination, where the hitchhiking effect can be limited to a small (<1 kb) region. Application of the H test to published surveys of Drosophila variation reveals an excess of high frequency variants that are likely to have been influenced by positive selection.},

We identified and validated 99 base substitutions and 17 small and large insertions and deletions. Our results imply a spontaneous mutation rate of 7 x 10(-9) base substitutions per site per generation, the majority of which are G:C-->A:T transitions. We explain this very biased spectrum of base substitution mutations as a result of two main processes: deamination of methylated cytosines and ultraviolet light-induced mutagenesis.},

title = {How frequent are correlated changes in families of protein sequences?},
abstract = {A loss-of-function point mutation in a protein is often rescued by an additional mutation that compensates for the original physical change. According to one hypothesis, such compensation would be most effective in maintaining a structural motif if the two mutated residues were spatial neighbors. If this hypothesis were correct, one would expect that many such compensatory mutations have occurred during evolution and that present-day protein families show some degree of correlation in the occurrence of amino acid residues at positions whose side chains are in contact. Here, a statistical theory is presented which allows evaluation of correlations in a family of aligned protein sequences by assigning a scalar metric (such as charge or side-chain volume) to each type of amino acid and calculating correlation coefficients of these quantities at different positions. For the family of myoglobins it is found that there is a high correlation between fluctuations in neighboring charges. The correlation is close to what would be expected for total conservation of local charge. For the metric side-chain volume, on the other hand, no correlation could be found.},

abstract = {Using paired-end sequences from bacterial artificial chromosomes, we have constructed high-resolution synteny and rearrangement breakpoint maps among human, mouse, and rat genomes. Among the >300 syntenic blocks identified are segments of over 40 Mb without any detected interspecies rearrangements, as well as regions with frequently broken synteny and extensive rearrangements. As closely related species, mouse and rat share the majority of the breakpoints and often have the same types of rearrangements when compared with the human genome. However, the breakpoints not shared between them indicate that mouse rearrangements are more often interchromosomal, whereas intrachromosomal rearrangements are more prominent in rat. Centromeres may have played a significant role in reorganizing a number of chromosomes in all three species. The comparison of the three species indicates that genome rearrangements follow a path that accommodates a delicate balance between maintaining a basic structure underlying all mammalian species and permitting variations that are necessary for speciation.},

A projection technique is employed to derive equations of motion for the phase space density of the slow variables by eliminating the fast ones.

We discuss some model situations and explore the accuracy of the approximations by numerical simulations.},

abstract = {Defining the functional relationships between proteins is critical for understanding virtually all aspects of cell biology. Large-scale identification of protein complexes has provided one important step towards this goal; however, even knowledge of the stoichiometry, affinity and lifetime of every protein-protein interaction would not reveal the functional relationships between and within such complexes. Genetic interactions can provide functional information that is largely invisible to protein-protein interaction data sets. Here we present an epistatic miniarray profile (E-MAP) consisting of quantitative pairwise measurements of the genetic interactions between 743 Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes involved in various aspects of chromosome biology (including DNA replication/repair, chromatid segregation and transcriptional regulation). This E-MAP reveals that physical interactions fall into two well-represented classes distinguished by whether or not the individual proteins act coherently to carry out a common function. Thus, genetic interaction data make it possible to dissect functionally multi-protein complexes, including Mediator, and to organize distinct protein complexes into pathways. In one pathway defined here, we show that Rtt109 is the founding member of a novel class of histone acetyltransferases responsible for Asf1-dependent acetylation of histone H3 on lysine 56. This modification, in turn, enables a ubiquitin ligase complex containing the cullin Rtt101 to ensure genomic integrity during DNA replication.},

abstract = {Experiments on Drosophila suggest that genetic recombination may result in lowered fitness of progeny (a 'recombination load'). This has been interpreted as evidence either for a direct effect of recombination on fitness, or for the maintenance of linkage disequilibria by epistatic selection. Here we show that such a recombination load is to be expected even if selection favours increased genetic recombination. This is because of the fact that, although a modifier may suffer an immediate loss of fitness if it increases recombination, it eventually becomes associated with a higher additive genetic variance in fitness, which allows a faster response to direction selection. This argument applies to mutation-selection balance with synergistic epistasis, directional selection on quantitative traits, and ectopic exchange among transposable elements. Further experiments are needed to determine whether the selection against recombination due to the immediate load is outweighed by the increased additive variance in fitness produced by recombination.},

title = {Dissection of a circumscribed recombination hot spot in HIV-1 after a single infectious cycle},
abstract = {Recombination is a major source of genetic heterogeneity in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) population. The main mechanism responsible for the generation of recombinant viruses is a process of copy choice between the two copies of genomic RNA during reverse transcription. We previously identified, after a single cycle of infection of cells in culture, a recombination hot spot within the gp120 gene, corresponding to the top portion of a RNA hairpin. Here, we determine that the hot region is circumscribed to 18 nucleotides located in the descending strand of the stem, following the sense of reverse transcription. Three factors appeared to be important, albeit at different extents, for the high rate of recombination observed in this region. The position of the hot sequence in the context of the RNA structure appears crucial, because changing its location within this structure triggered differences in recombination up to 20-fold. Another pivotal factor is the presence of a perfectly identical sequence between donor and acceptor RNA in the region of transfer, because single or double nucleotide differences in the hot spot were sufficient to almost completely abolish recombination in the region. Last, the primary structure of the hot region also influenced recombination, although with effects only in the 2-3-fold range. Altogether, these results provide the first molecular dissection of a hot spot in infected cells and indicate that several factors contribute to the generation of a site of preferential copy choice.},

We detected diabetes susceptibility loci in and around the genes CDKAL1, CDKN2A/CDKN2B, and IGF2BP2 and confirmed the recently described associations at HHEX/IDE and SLC30A8. Our findings provide insight into the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes, emphasizing the contribution of multiple variants of modest effect.

title = {Neutralizing antibody responses drive the evolution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope during recent HIV infection},
abstract = {HIV type 1 (HIV-1) can rapidly escape from neutralizing antibody responses. The genetic basis of this escape in vivo is poorly understood. We compared the pattern of evolution of the HIV-1 env gene between individuals with recent HIV infection whose virus exhibited either a low or a high rate of escape from neutralizing antibody responses. We demonstrate that the rate of viral escape at a phenotypic level is highly variable among individuals, and is strongly correlated with the rate of amino acid substitutions. We show that dramatic escape from neutralizing antibodies can occur in the relative absence of changes in glycosylation or insertions and deletions ("indels") in the envelope; conversely, changes in glycosylation and indels occur even in the absence of neutralizing antibody responses. Comparison of our data with the predictions of a mathematical model support a mechanism in which escape from neutralizing antibodies occurs via many amino acid substitutions, with low cross-neutralization between closely related viral strains. Our results suggest that autologous neutralizing antibody responses may play a pivotal role in the diversification of HIV-1 envelope during the early stages of infection.},

title = {An improved, bias-reduced probabilistic functional gene network of baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Probabilistic functional gene networks are powerful theoretical frameworks for integrating heterogeneous functional genomics and proteomics data into objective models of cellular systems. Such networks provide syntheses of millions of discrete experimental observations, spanning DNA microarray experiments, physical protein interactions, genetic interactions, and comparative genomics; the resulting networks can then be easily applied to generate testable hypotheses regarding specific gene functions and associations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We report a significantly improved version (v. 2) of a probabilistic functional gene network of the baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We describe our optimization methods and illustrate their effects in three major areas: the reduction of functional bias in network training reference sets, the application of a probabilistic model for calculating confidences in pair-wise protein physical or genetic interactions, and the introduction of simple thresholds that eliminate many false positive mRNA co-expression relationships. Using the network, we predict and experimentally verify the function of the yeast RNA binding protein Puf6 in 60S ribosomal subunit biogenesis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: YeastNet v. 2, constructed using these optimizations together with additional data, shows significant reduction in bias and improvements in precision and recall, in total covering 102,803 linkages among 5,483 yeast proteins (95% of the validated proteome).

title = {Mutation and the evolution of recombination},
abstract = {Under the classical view, selection depends more or less directly on mutation: standing genetic variance is maintained by a balance between selection and mutation, and adaptation is fuelled by new favourable mutations. Recombination is favoured if it breaks negative associations among selected alleles, which interfere with adaptation. Such associations may be generated by negative epistasis, or by random drift (leading to the Hill-Robertson effect). Both deterministic and stochastic explanations depend primarily on the genomic mutation rate, U. This may be large enough to explain high recombination rates in some organisms, but seems unlikely to be so in general. Random drift is a more general source of negative linkage disequilibria, and can cause selection for recombination even in large populations, through the chance loss of new favourable mutations. The rate of species-wide substitutions is much too low to drive this mechanism, but local fluctuations in selection, combined with gene flow, may suffice. These arguments are illustrated by comparing the interaction between good and bad mutations at unlinked loci under the infinitesimal model.},

abstract = {Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) allows the investigation of the physicochemical environment of fluorochromes and protein-protein interaction mapping by Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) in living cells. However, simpler and cheaper solutions are required before this powerful analytical technique finds a broader application in the life sciences. Wide-field frequency-domain FLIM represents a solution whose application is currently limited by the need for multichannel-plate image intensifiers. We recently showed the feasibility of using a charge-coupled device/complementory metal-oxide semiconductor (CCD/CMOS) hybrid lock-in imager, originally developed for 3-D vision, as an add-on device for lifetime measurements on existing wide-field microscopes. In the present work, the performance of the setup is validated by comparison with well-established wide-field frequency-domain FLIM measurements. Furthermore, we combine the lock-in imager with solid-state light sources. This results in a simple, inexpensive, and compact FLIM system, operating at a video rate and capable of single-shot acquisition by virtue of the unique parallel retrieval of two phase-dependent images. This novel FLIM setup is used for cellular and FRET imaging, and for high-throughput and fast imaging applications. The all-solid-state design bridges the technological gap that limits the use of FLIM in areas such as drug discovery and medical diagnostics.},

abstract = { The nature of epistasis has important consequences for the evolutionary significance of sex and recombination. Recent efforts to find negative epistasis as source of negative linkage disequilibrium and associated long-term sex advantage have yielded little support. Sign epistasis, where the sign of the fitness effects of alleles varies across genetic backgrounds, is responsible for ruggedness of the fitness landscape with implications for the evolution of sex that have been largely unexplored. Here, we describe fitness landscapes for two sets of strains of the asexual fungus \emph{Aspergillus niger} involving all combinations of five mutations. We find that {\$}\sim 30{\$}% of the single-mutation fitness effects are positive despite their negative effect in the wild-type strain, and that several local fitness maxima and minima are present. We then compare adaptation of sexual and asexual populations on these empirical fitness landscapes using simulations. The results show a general disadvantage of sex on these rugged landscapes, caused by the break down by recombination of genotypes escaping from local peaks. Sex facilitates escape from a local peak only for some parameter values on one landscape, indicating its dependence on the landscape's topography. We discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy between our results and the reports of faster adaptation of sexual populations. },

title = {Directional selection and the evolution of sex and recombination},
abstract = {Models of the evolutionary advantages of sex and genetic recombination due to directional selection on a quantitative trait are analysed. The models assume that the trait is controlled by many additive genes. A nor-optimal selection function is used, in which the optimum either moves steadily in one direction, follows an autocorrelated linear Markov process or a random walk, or varies cyclically. The consequences for population mean fitness of a reduction in genetic variance, due to a shift from sexual to asexual reproduction are examined. It is shown that a large reduction in mean fitness can result from such a shift in the case of a steadily moving optimum, under light conditions. The conditions are much more stringent with a cyclical or randomly varying environment, especially if the autocorrelation for a random environment is small. The conditions for spread of a rare modifier affecting the rate of genetic recombination are also examined, and the strength of selection on such a modifier determined. Again, the case of a steadily moving optimum is most favourable for the evolution of increased recombination. The selection pressure on a recombination modifier when a trait is subject to strong truncation selection is calculated, and shown to be large enough to account for observed increases in recombination associated with artificial selection. Theoretical and empirical evidence relevant to evaluating the importance of this model for the evolution of sex and recombination is discussed.},

abstract = {Why sex evolved and persists is a problem for evolutionary biology, because sex disrupts favourable gene combinations and requires an expenditure of time and energy. Further, in organisms with unequal-sized gametes, the female transmits her genes at only half the rate of an asexual equivalent (the twofold cost of sex). Many modern theories that provide an explanation for the advantage of sex incorporate an idea originally proposed by Weismann more than 100 years ago: sex allows natural selection to proceed more effectively because it increases genetic variation. Here we test this hypothesis, which still lacks robust empirical support, with the use of experiments on yeast populations. Capitalizing on recent advances in the molecular biology of recombination in yeast, we produced by genetic manipulation strains that differed only in their capacity for sexual reproduction. We show that, as predicted by the theory, sex increases the rate of adaptation to a new harsh environment but has no measurable effect on fitness in a new benign environment where there is little selection.},

title = {Estimation of an in vivo fitness landscape experienced by HIV-1 under drug selective pressure useful for prediction of drug resistance evolution during treatment},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: HIV-1 antiviral resistance is a major cause of antiviral treatment failure. The in vivo fitness landscape experienced by the virus in presence of treatment could in principle be used to determine both the susceptibility of the virus to the treatment and the genetic barrier to resistance. We propose a method to estimate this fitness landscape from cross-sectional clinical genetic sequence data of different subtypes, by reverse engineering the required selective pressure for HIV-1 sequences obtained from treatment naive patients, to evolve towards sequences obtained from treated patients. The method was evaluated for recovering 10 random fictive selective pressures in simulation experiments, and for modeling the selective pressure under treatment with the protease inhibitor nelfinavir. RESULTS: The estimated fitness function under nelfinavir treatment considered fitness contributions of 114 mutations at 48 sites. Estimated fitness correlated significantly with the in vitro resistance phenotype in 519 matched genotype-phenotype pairs (R(2) = 0.47 (0.41 - 0.54)) and variation in predicted evolution under nelfinavir selective pressure correlated significantly with observed in vivo evolution during nelfinavir treatment for 39 mutations (with FDR = 0.05).

title = {Recombination Rate and Selection Strength in {HIV} Intra-patient Evolution},
abstract = {The evolutionary dynamics of HIV during the chronic phase of infection is driven by the host immune response and by selective pressures exerted through drug treatment. To understand and model the evolution of HIV quantitatively, the parameters governing genetic diversification and the strength of selection need to be known. While mutation rates can be measured in single replication cycles, the relevant effective recombination rate depends on the probability of coinfection of a cell with more than one virus and can only be inferred from population data. However, most population genetic estimators for recombination rates assume absence of selection and are hence of limited applicability to HIV, since positive and purifying selection are important in HIV evolution. Yet, little is known about the distribution of selection differentials between individual viruses and the impact of single polymorphisms on viral fitness. Here, we estimate the rate of recombination and the distribution of selection coefficients from time series sequence data tracking the evolution of HIV within single patients. By examining temporal changes in the genetic composition of the population, we estimate the effective recombination to be rho = 1.4+/-0.6x10(-5) recombinations per site and generation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the selection coefficients of at least 15% of the observed non-synonymous polymorphisms exceed 0.8% per generation. These results provide a basis for a more detailed understanding of the evolution of HIV. A particularly interesting case is evolution in response to drug treatment, where recombination can facilitate the rapid acquisition of multiple resistance mutations. With the methods developed here, more precise and more detailed studies will be possible as soon as data with higher time resolution and greater sample sizes are available.},

title = {A population genetics model for multiple quantitative traits exhibiting pleiotropy and epistasis},
abstract = {We study a population genetics model of an organism with a genome of L(tot)loci that determine the values of T quantitative traits. Each trait is controlled by a subset of L loci assigned randomly from the genome. There is an optimum value for each trait, and stabilizing selection acts on the phenotype as a whole to maintain actual trait values close to their optima. The model contains pleiotropic effects (loci can affect more than one trait) and epistasis in fitness. We use adaptive walk simulations to find high-fitness genotypes and to study the way these genotypes are distributed in sequence space. We then simulate the evolution of haploid and diploid populations on these fitness landscapes and show that the genotypes of populations are able to drift through sequence space despite stabilizing selection on the phenotype. We study the way the rate of drift and the extent of the accessible region of sequence space is affected by mutation rate, selection strength, population size, recombination rate, and the parameters L and T that control the landscape shape. There are three regimes of the model. If LT<<L(tot), there are many high fitness genotypes and the population may evolve neutrally on high-fitness plateaux. If LT approximately L(tot), there are a few high-fitness genotypes which tend to be close together. The population is confined to a small region of sequence space if selection is strong, but can explore more widely if selection is weaker. If LT>>L(tot), there are many small peaks that can be spread over a wide region of sequence space. Compensatory neutral mutations are important in the population dynamics in this case.},

abstract = {Hybridization is an important factor in the evolution of plants; however, many of the studies that have examined hybrid fitness have been concerned with the study of early generation hybrids. We examined the early- and late-generation fitness consequences of hybridization between two ecotypes of the selfing annual Avena barbata in a greenhouse environment as well as in two natural environments. Fitness of early generation (F2) hybrids reflects both the action of dominance effects (hybrid vigor) and recombination (hybrid breakdown) and was not significantly different from that of the midparent in any environment. Fitness of later generation (F6) recombinant inbred lines (RILS) derived from the cross reflect both the loss of early generation heterozygosity as well as disruption of any coadapted gene complexes present in the parents. In all environments, F6 RILs were on average significantly less fit than the (equally homozygous) midparent, indicating hybrid breakdown through the disruption of epistatic interactions. However, the inbred F6 were also less fit than the heterozygous F2, indicating that hybrid vigor also occurs in A. barbata, and counteracts hybrid breakdown in early generation hybrids. Also, although the F6 generation mean is lower than the midparent mean, there are individual genotypes within the F6 generation that are capable of outperforming the parental ecotypes in the greenhouse. Fewer hybrid genotypes are capable of outperforming the parental ecotypes in the field. Overall, these experiments demonstrate how a single hybridization event can result in a number of outcomes including hybrid vigor, hybrid breakdown, and transgressive segregation, which interact to determine long-term hybrid fitness.},

title = {Evolution of mutational robustness in an RNA virus},
abstract = {Mutational (genetic) robustness is phenotypic constancy in the face of mutational changes to the genome. Robustness is critical to the understanding of evolution because phenotypically expressed genetic variation is the fuel of natural selection. Nonetheless, the evidence for adaptive evolution of mutational robustness in biological populations is controversial. Robustness should be selectively favored when mutation rates are high, a common feature of RNA viruses. However, selection for robustness may be relaxed under virus co-infection because complementation between virus genotypes can buffer mutational effects. We therefore hypothesized that selection for genetic robustness in viruses will be weakened with increasing frequency of co-infection. To test this idea, we used populations of RNA phage phi6 that were experimentally evolved at low and high levels of co-infection and subjected lineages of these viruses to mutation accumulation through population bottlenecking. The data demonstrate that viruses evolved under high co-infection show relatively greater mean magnitude and variance in the fitness changes generated by addition of random mutations, confirming our hypothesis that they experience weakened selection for robustness. Our study further suggests that co-infection of host cells may be advantageous to RNA viruses only in the short term. In addition, we observed higher mutation frequencies in the more robust viruses, indicating that evolution of robustness might foster less-accurate genome replication in RNA viruses.},

title = {The neoselectionist theory of genome evolution},
abstract = {The vertebrate genome is a mosaic of GC-poor and GC-rich isochores, megabase-sized DNA regions of fairly homogeneous base composition that differ in relative amount, gene density, gene expression, replication timing, and recombination frequency. At the emergence of warm-blooded vertebrates, the gene-rich, moderately GC-rich isochores of the cold-blooded ancestors underwent a GC increase. This increase was similar in mammals and birds and was maintained during the evolution of mammalian and avian orders. Neither the GC increase nor its conservation can be accounted for by the random fixation of neutral or nearly neutral single-nucleotide changes (i.e., the vast majority of nucleotide substitutions) or by a biased gene conversion process occurring at random genome locations. Both phenomena can be explained, however, by the neoselectionist theory of genome evolution that is presented here. This theory fully accepts Ohta's nearly neutral view of point mutations but proposes in addition (i) that the AT-biased mutational input present in vertebrates pushes some DNA regions below a certain GC threshold; (ii) that these lower GC levels cause regional changes in chromatin structure that lead to deleterious effects on replication and transcription; and (iii) that the carriers of these changes undergo negative (purifying) selection, the final result being a compositional conservation of the original isochore pattern in the surviving population. Negative selection may also largely explain the GC increase accompanying the emergence of warm-blooded vertebrates. In conclusion, the neoselectionist theory not only provides a solution to the neutralist/selectionist debate but also introduces an epigenomic component in genome evolution.},

title = {Epistasis and balanced polymorphism influencing complex trait variation},
abstract = {Complex traits such as human disease, growth rate, or crop yield are polygenic, or determined by the contributions from numerous genes in a quantitative manner. Although progress has been made in identifying major quantitative trait loci (QTL), experimental constraints have limited our knowledge of small-effect QTL, which may be responsible for a large proportion of trait variation. Here, we identified and dissected a one-centimorgan chromosome interval in Arabidopsis thaliana without regard to its effect on growth rate, and examined the signature of historical sequence polymorphism among Arabidopsis accessions. We found that the interval contained two growth rate QTL within 210 kilobases. Both QTL showed epistasis; that is, their phenotypic effects depended on the genetic background. This amount of complexity in such a small area suggests a highly polygenic architecture of quantitative variation, much more than previously documented. One QTL was limited to a single gene. The gene in question displayed a nucleotide signature indicative of balancing selection, and its phenotypic effects are reversed depending on genetic background. If this region typifies many complex trait loci, then non-neutral epistatic polymorphism may be an important contributor to genetic variation in complex traits.},

This algorithm found that 12% of bases in the human genome are evolutionarily constrained-double the number detected by nucleotide sequence-based algorithms. Topography-informed constrained regions correlated with functional noncoding elements, including enhancers, better than did regions identified solely on the basis of nucleotide sequence.

abstract = {What are the forces that shape the structure of prokaryotic genomes: the order of genes, their proximity, and their orientation? Coregulation and coordinated horizontal gene transfer are believed to promote the proximity of functionally related genes and the formation of operons. However, forces that influence the structure of the genome beyond the level of a single operon remain unknown. Here, we show that the biophysical mechanism by which regulatory proteins search for their sites on DNA can impose constraints on genome structure. Using simulations, we demonstrate that rapid and reliable gene regulation requires that the transcription factor (TF) gene be close to the site on DNA the TF has to bind, thus promoting the colocalization of TF genes and their targets on the genome. We use parameters that have been measured in recent experiments to estimate the relevant length and times scales of this process and demonstrate that the search for a cognate site may be prohibitively slow if a TF has a low copy number and is not colocalized. We also analyze TFs and their sites in a number of bacterial genomes, confirm that they are colocalized significantly more often than expected, and show that this observation cannot be attributed to the pressure for coregulation or formation of selfish gene clusters, thus supporting the role of the biophysical constraint in shaping the structure of prokaryotic genomes. Our results demonstrate how spatial organization can influence timing and noise in gene expression.},

title = {SequenceLDhot: detecting recombination hotspots},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: There is much local variation in recombination rates across the human genome--with the majority of recombination occurring in recombination hotspots--short regions of around approximately 2 kb in length that have much higher recombination rates than neighbouring regions. Knowledge of this local variation is important, e.g. in the design and analysis of association studies for disease genes. Population genetic data, such as that generated by the HapMap project, can be used to infer the location of these hotspots. We present a new, efficient and powerful method for detecting recombination hotspots from population data. RESULTS: We compare our method with four current methods for detecting hotspots. It is orders of magnitude quicker, and has greater power, than two related approaches. It appears to be more powerful than HotspotFisher, though less accurate at inferring the precise positions of the hotspot. It was also more powerful than LDhot in some situations: particularly for weaker hotspots (10-40 times the background rate) when SNP density is lower (< 1/kb). AVAILABILITY: Program, data sets, and full details of results are available at: http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~fearnhea/Hotspot.},

abstract = {Fine scale analyses of signatures of selection allow assessing quantitative aspects of a species' evolutionary genetic history, such as the strength of selection on genes. When several selected loci lie in the same genomic region, their epistatic interactions may also be investigated. Here, we study how the neutral polymorphism pattern was shaped by two close recombining loci that cause 'sex-ratio' meiotic drive in Drosophila simulans, as an example of strong selection with potentially strong epistasis. We compare the polymorphism data observed in a natural population with the results of forward stochastic simulations under several contexts of epistasis between the candidate loci for the drive. We compute the likelihood of different possible scenarios, in order to determine which configuration is most consistent with the data. Our results highlight that fine scale analyses of well-chosen candidate genomic regions provide information-rich data that can be used to investigate the genotype-phenotype-fitness map, which can hardly be studied in genome-wide analyses. We also emphasize that initial conditions and time of observation (here, time after the interruption of a partial selective sweep) are crucial parameters in the interpretation of real data, while these are often overlooked in theoretical studies.},

title = {Evolution of human immunodeficiency virus under selection and weak recombination},
abstract = {To predict emergence of drug resistance in patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy, we study accumulation of preexisting beneficial alleles in a haploid population of N genomes. The factors included in the model are selection with the coefficient s and recombination with the small rate per genome r (r << s sqrt of k, where k is the average number of less-fit loci per genome). Mutation events are neglected. To describe evolution at a large number of linked loci, we generalize the analytic method we developed recently for an asexual population. We show that the distribution of genomes over the deleterious allele number moves in time as a "solitary wave" that is quasi-deterministic in the middle (on the average) but has stochastic edges. We arrive at a single-locus expression for the average accumulation rate, in which the effects of linkage, recombination, and random drift are all accounted for by the effective selection coefficient s lnNr/lnNs(2)k/r. At large N, the effective selection coefficient approaches the single-locus value s. Below the critical size N(c) approximately 1/r, a population eventually becomes a clone, recombination cannot produce new sequences, and virus evolution stops. Taking into account finite mutation rate predicts a small, finite rate of evolution at N < N(c). We verify the accuracy of the results analytically and by Monte Carlo simulation. On the basis of our findings, we predict that partial depletion of the HIV population by combined anti-retroviral therapy can suppress emergence of drug-resistant strains.},

abstract = {Recombinants of preexisting human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains are now circulating globally. To increase our understanding of the importance of these recombinants, we assessed recombination within an individual infected from a single source by studying the linkage patterns of the auxiliary genes of HIV-1 subtype B. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic techniques revealed evidence for recombination from topological incongruence among adjacent genes. Coalescent methods were then used to estimate the in vivo recombination rate. The estimated mean rate of 1.38 x 10(-4) recombination events/adjacent sites/generation is approximately 5.5-fold greater than the reported point mutation rate of 2.5 x 10(-5)/site/generation. Recombination was found to be frequent enough to mask evidence for purifying selection by Tajima's D test. Thus, recombination is a major evolutionary force affecting genetic variation within an HIV-1-infected individual, of the same order of magnitude as point mutational change.},

abstract = {I here introduce a free fitness function in population biology, which monotonically increases with time and takes its maximum at the evolutionary equilibrium. By suitably defining an "index" for each state, the free fitness is expressed as the average index plus an entropy term. In many cases, the index has a biologically clear meaning, such as the logarithmic population mean fitness. The technique is applicable to any Markov process model (either continuous or discrete) with a positive steady state. I discuss four examples from various branches of population biology: (1) one-locus-two-allele system of population genetics with mutation, selection, and random genetic drift; (2) evolutionary dynamics of quantitative characters; (3) a molecular evolution model; and (4) an ecological succession model. Introducing free fitness clarifies the balance between systematic forces (e.g. natural selection or successional trend toward the climax) and disturbing processes (e.g. random drift).},

abstract = {Selection is usually considered to be the dominant force controlling viral variation; the large population sizes suggest that deterministic population genetic models are appropriate. To investigate their validity for HIV, samples of env gene sequences were tested for departure from neutrality because of mutation-selection balance. None of the samples departed significantly when tested as nucleotide sequences. At the amino acid level, significantly elevated diversity was detected in two samples within, but not outside, the V3 loop. The effective population number has been estimated (using a phylogenetic method) to be close to 10(3). Estimates from nucleotide diversity are about 2-fold lower. The low value of the effective population number might arise from high variability in progeny number between infected cells, from the expansion in population number from a small inoculum as the virus is transmitted between hosts, or from variable selection at linked sites. These results suggest that the population genetics of HIV are best described by stochastic models.},

title = {Epistasis for fitness-related quantitative traits in Arabidopsis thaliana grown in the field and in the greenhouse},
abstract = {The extent to which epistasis contributes to adaptation, population differentiation, and speciation is a long-standing and important problem in evolutionary genetics. Using recombinant inbred (RI) lines of Arabidopsis thaliana grown under natural field conditions, we have examined the genetic architecture of fitness-correlated traits with respect to epistasis; we identified both single-locus additive and two-locus epistatic QTL for natural variation in fruit number, germination, and seed length and width. For fruit number, we found seven significant epistatic interactions, but only two additive QTL. For seed germination, length, and width, there were from two to four additive QTL and from five to eight epistatic interactions. The epistatic interactions were both positive and negative. In each case, the magnitude of the epistatic effects was roughly double that of the effects of the additive QTL, varying from -41% to +29% for fruit number and from -5% to +4% for seed germination, length, and width. A number of the QTL that we describe participate in more than one epistatic interaction, and some loci identified as additive also may participate in an epistatic interaction; the genetic architecture for fitness traits may be a network of additive and epistatic effects. We compared the map positions of the additive and epistatic QTL for germination, seed width, and seed length from plants grown in both the field and the greenhouse. While the total number of significant additive and epistatic QTL was similar under the two growth conditions, the map locations were largely different. We found a small number of significant epistatic QTL x environment effects when we tested directly for them. Our results support the idea that epistatic interactions are an important part of natural genetic variation and reinforce the need for caution in comparing results from greenhouse-grown and field-grown plants.},

title = {Population evolution on a multiplicative single-peak fitness landscape},
abstract = {A theory for evolution of either gene sequences or molecular sequences must take into account that a population consists of a finite number of individuals with related sequences. Such a population will not behave in the deterministic way expected for an infinite population, nor will it behave as in adaptive walk models, where the whole of the population is represented by a single sequence. Here we study a model for evolution of population in a fitness landscape with a single fitness peak. This landscape is simple enough for finite size population effects to be studied in detail. Each of the N individuals in the population is represented by a sequence of L genes which may either be advantageous or disadvantageous. The fitness of an individual with k disadvantageous genes is Wk = (1-s)k, where s determines the strength of selection. In the limit L-->infinity, the model reduces to the problem of Muller's Ratchet: the population moves away from the fitness peak at a constant rate due to the accumulation of disadvantageous mutations. For finite length sequences, a population placed initially at the fitness peak will evolve away from the peak until a balance is reached between mutation and selection. From then on the population will wander through a spherical shell in sequence space at a constant mean Hamming distance <k> from the optimum sequence. We give an approximate theory for the way <k> depends on N, L, s, and the mutation rate u. This is found to agree well with numerical simulation. Selection is less effective on small populations, so <k> increases as N decreases. Our simulations also show that the mean overlap between gene sequences separated by a time of t generations is of the form Q(t) = Q infinity + (Q0-Q infinity)exp(-2ut), which means that the rate of evolution within the spherical shell is independent of the selection strength. We give a simplified model which can be solved exactly for which Q(t) has precisely this form. We then consider the limit L-->infinity keeping U = uL constant. We suppose that each mutation may be favourable with probability p, or unfavourable with probability 1-p. We show that for p less than a critical value pc, the population decreases in fitness for all values of U, whereas for pc < p < 1/2, the population increases in fitness for small U and decreases in fitness for large U. In this case there is an optimum non-zero value of U at which the fitness increases most rapidly, and natural selection will favour species with non-zero mutation rates.},

title = {A biophysical approach to transcription factor binding site discovery},
abstract = {Identification of transcription factor binding sites within regulatory segments of genomic DNA is an important step toward understanding of the regulatory circuits that control expression of genes. Here, we describe a novel bioinformatics method that bases classification of potential binding sites explicitly on the estimate of sequence-specific binding energy of a given transcription factor. The method also estimates the chemical potential of the factor that defines the threshold of binding. In contrast with the widely used information-theoretic weight matrix method, the new approach correctly describes saturation in the transcription factor/DNA binding probability. This results in a significant improvement in the number of expected false positives, particularly in the ubiquitous case of low-specificity factors. In the strong binding limit, the algorithm is related to the "support vector machine" approach to pattern recognition. The new method is used to identify likely genomic binding sites for the E. coli transcription factors collected in the DPInteract database. In addition, for CRP (a global regulatory factor), the likely regulatory modality (i.e., repressor or activator) of predicted binding sites is determined.},

abstract = {The maturation of Xenopus oocytes can be thought of as a process of cell fate induction, with the immature oocyte representing the default fate and the mature oocyte representing the induced fate. Crucial mediators of Xenopus oocyte maturation, including the p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the cell-division cycle protein kinase Cdc2, are known to be organized into positive feedback loops. In principle, such positive feedback loops could produce an actively maintained 'memory' of a transient inductive stimulus and could explain the irreversibility of maturation. Here we show that the p42 MAPK and Cdc2 system normally generates an irreversible biochemical response from a transient stimulus, but the response becomes transient when positive feedback is blocked. Our results explain how a group of intrinsically reversible signal transducers can generate an irreversible response at a systems level, and show how a cell fate can be maintained by a self-sustaining pattern of protein kinase activation.},

abstract = {Our results show that experimental evolution mimics evolution in nature. In particular, only 1,000 generations of periodic recombination with immigrant genotypes is enough for linkage disequilibrium values in experimental populations to change from a maximum linkage value to a value similar to the one observed in wild strains of E. coli. Our analysis suggests an analogy between the recombination experiment and the evolutionary history of E. coli; the E. coli genome is a patchwork of genes laterally inserted in a common backbone, and the experimental E. coli chromosome is a patchwork where some sites are highly prone to recombination and others are very clonal. In addition, we propose a population model for wild E. coli where gene flow (recombination and migration) are an important source of genetic variation, and where certain hosts act as selective sieves; i.e., the host digestive system allows only certain strains to adhere and prosper as resident strains generating a particular microbiota in each host. Therefore we suggest that the strains from a wide range of wild hosts from different regions of the world may present an ecotypic structure where adaptation to the host may play an important role in the population structure.},

Despite efforts from many theorists and empiricists, fundamental questions are still open, in particular, for the population genetics of regions of reduced recombination. On the other hand, the development of the BGS and hitchhiking models and the long struggle to distinguish them, all of which seem to be a purely academic exercise, led to quite practical advances that are useful for the identification of genes involved in adaptation and domestication.},

Although the oncogenic or tumor-suppressing functions of several microRNAs have been characterized, the mechanistic roles played by microRNAs specifically in mediating metastasis have been addressed only recently. In this review, we focus on our emerging understanding of the contributions of microRNAs to malignant progression, specifically their functions in mediating tumor invasion and metastasis. These findings illuminate the molecular basis of metastasis and begin to connect small-RNA discoveries to the development of novel clinical biomarkers and therapeutic targets in neoplastic diseases.},

We show theoretically that conditioning on a dependence kernel is sufficient to render statistical tests independent regardless of the level of dependence in the observed data. This framework for multiple testing dependence has implications in a variety of common multiple testing problems, such as in gene expression studies, brain imaging, and spatial epidemiology.},

title = {Are there rearrangement hotspots in the human genome?},
abstract = {In a landmark paper, Nadeau and Taylor [18] formulated the random breakage model (RBM) of chromosome evolution that postulates that there are no rearrangement hotspots in the human genome. In the next two decades, numerous studies with progressively increasing levels of resolution made RBM the de facto theory of chromosome evolution. Despite the fact that RBM had prophetic prediction power, it was recently refuted by Pevzner and Tesler [4], who introduced the fragile breakage model (FBM), postulating that the human genome is a mosaic of solid regions (with low propensity for rearrangements) and fragile regions (rearrangement hotspots). However, the rebuttal of RBM caused a controversy and led to a split among researchers studying genome evolution. In particular, it remains unclear whether some complex rearrangements (e.g., transpositions) can create an appearance of rearrangement hotspots. We contribute to the ongoing debate by analyzing multi-break rearrangements that break a genome into multiple fragments and further glue them together in a new order. In particular, we demonstrate that (1) even if transpositions were a dominant force in mammalian evolution, the arguments in favor of FBM still stand, and (2) the "gene deletion" argument against FBM is flawed.},

title = {Genotypic predictors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 drug resistance},
abstract = {Understanding the genetic basis of HIV-1 drug resistance is essential to developing new antiretroviral drugs and optimizing the use of existing drugs. This understanding, however, is hampered by the large numbers of mutation patterns associated with cross-resistance within each antiretroviral drug class. We used five statistical learning methods (decision trees, neural networks, support vector regression, least-squares regression, and least angle regression) to relate HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase mutations to in vitro susceptibility to 16 antiretroviral drugs. Learning methods were trained and tested on a public data set of genotype-phenotype correlations by 5-fold cross-validation. For each learning method, four mutation sets were used as input features: a complete set of all mutations in > or =2 sequences in the data set, the 30 most common data set mutations, an expert panel mutation set, and a set of nonpolymorphic treatment-selected mutations from a public database linking protease and reverse transcriptase sequences to antiretroviral drug exposure. The nonpolymorphic treatment-selected mutations led to the best predictions: 80.1% accuracy at classifying sequences as susceptible, low/intermediate resistant, or highly resistant. Least angle regression predicted susceptibility significantly better than other methods when using the complete set of mutations. The three regression methods provided consistent estimates of the quantitative effect of mutations on drug susceptibility, identifying nearly all previously reported genotype-phenotype associations and providing strong statistical support for many new associations. Mutation regression coefficients showed that, within a drug class, cross-resistance patterns differ for different mutation subsets and that cross-resistance has been underestimated.},

title = {Soft sweeps II--molecular population genetics of adaptation from recurrent mutation or migration},
abstract = {In the classical model of molecular adaptation, a favored allele derives from a single mutational origin. This ignores that beneficial alleles can enter a population recurrently, either by mutation or migration, during the selective phase. In this case, descendants of several of these independent origins may contribute to the fixation. As a consequence, all ancestral haplotypes that are linked to any of these copies will be retained in the population, affecting the pattern of a selective sweep on linked neutral variation. In this study, we use analytical calculations based on coalescent theory and computer simulations to analyze molecular adaptation from recurrent mutation or migration. Under the assumption of complete linkage, we derive a robust analytical approximation for the number of ancestral haplotypes and their distribution in a sample from the population. We find that so-called "soft sweeps," where multiple ancestral haplotypes appear in a sample, are likely for biologically realistic values of mutation or migration rates.},

title = {The rate of adaptation in asexuals},
abstract = {I study the population genetics of adaptation in asexuals. I show that the rate of adaptive substitution in an asexual species or nonrecombining chromosome region is a bell-shaped function of the mutation rate: at some point, increasing the mutation rate decreases the rate of substitution. Curiously, the mutation rate that maximizes the rate of adaptation depends solely on the strength of selection against deleterious mutations. In particular, adaptation is fastest when the genomic rate of mutation, U, equals the harmonic mean of selection coefficients against deleterious mutations, where we assume that selection for favorable alleles is milder than that against deleterious ones. This simple result is independent of the shape of the distribution of effects among favorable and deleterious mutations, population size, and the action of clonal interference. In the course of this work, I derive an approximation to the probability of fixation of a favorable mutation in an asexual genome or nonrecombining chromosome region in which both favorable and deleterious mutations occur.},

Network connectivity was predictive of function because interactions often occurred among functionally related genes, and similar patterns of interactions tended to identify components of the same pathway. The genetic network exhibited dense local neighborhoods; therefore, the position of a gene on a partially mapped network is predictive of other genetic interactions. Because digenic interactions are common in yeast, similar networks may underlie the complex genetics associated with inherited phenotypes in other organisms.},

title = {Comparisons of site- and haplotype-frequency methods for detecting positive selection},
abstract = {In this report, we compare the differences between various site- and haplotype-frequency tests in their power to detect positive selection by doing computer simulations. Our results are the following. 1) Although haplotype-frequency tests that are conditional on the number of haplotypes (K) were developed for nonrecombining haplotypes, these tests are insensitive to recombination. Such tests, including the Ewens-Watterson (EW) test, can therefore be applied to recombining haplotypes. 2) Tests conditional on the number of segregating sites (S) become overly conservative in the presence of recombination. 3) The EW test is usually the most powerful test during the sweep phase, especially when the local recombination rate is high. 4) The "extended haplotype homozygosity" test relies heavily on the prior knowledge of the target of selection. With that knowledge, it is the most powerful test, whereas in the absence of this prior information, the test has little power. We also study the sensitivities of the haplotype-frequency tests to background selection and various demographic forces. We find that these tests are sensitive to some forces other than positive selection. To alleviate the problem of low specificity, compound tests, such as the DH test (Zeng et al. 2006), may be a solution. In the companion paper (Zeng K, Shi S, Wu C-I, in preparation), we use the EW test to devise 2 compound tests, which are more powerful in detecting positive selection than DH, but are also relatively insensitive to demography.},

title = {Towards a general theory of adaptive walks on rugged landscapes},
abstract = {Adaptive evolution, to a large extent, is a complex combinatorial optimization process. In this article we take beginning steps towards developing a general theory of adaptive "walks" via fitter variants in such optimization processes. We introduce the basic idea of a space of entities, each a 1-mutant neighbor of many other entities in the space, and the idea of a fitness ascribed to each entity. Adaptive walks proceed from an initial entity, via fitter neighbors, to locally or globally optimal entities that are fitter than their neighbors. We develop a general theory for the number of local optima, lengths of adaptive walks, and the number of alternative local optima accessible from any given initial entity, for the baseline case of an uncorrelated fitness landscape. Most fitness landscapes are correlated, however. Therefore we develop parts of a universal theory of adaptation on correlated landscapes by adaptive processes that have sufficient numbers of mutations per individual to "jump beyond" the correlation lengths in the underlying landscape. In addition, we explore the statistical character of adaptive walks in two independent complex combinatorial optimization problems, that of evolving a specific cell type in model genetic networks, and that of finding good solutions to the traveling salesman problem. Surprisingly, both show similar statistical features, encouraging the hope that a general theory for adaptive walks on correlated and uncorrelated landscapes can be found. In the final section we explore two limits to the efficacy of selection. The first is new, and surprising: for a wide class of systems, as the complexity of the entities under selection increases, the local optima that are attainable fall progressively closer to the mean properties of the underlying space of entities. This may imply that complex biological systems, such as genetic regulatory systems, are "close" to the mean properties of the ensemble of genomic regulatory systems explored by evolution. The second limit shows that with increasing complexity and a fixed mutation rate, selection often becomes unable to pull an adapting population to those local optima to which connected adaptive walks via fitter variants exist. These beginning steps in theory development are applied to maturation of the immune response, and to the problem of radiation and stasis. Despite the limitations of the adaptive landscape metaphor, we believe that further development along the lines begun here will prove useful.},

title = {Applying Hidden Markov Models to the Analysis of Single Ion Channel Activity},
abstract = {Hidden Markov models have recently been used to model single ion channel currents as recorded with the patch clamp technique from cell membranes. The estimation of hidden Markov models parameters using the forward-backward and Baum-Welch algorithms can be performed at signal to noise ratios that are too low for conventional single channel kinetic analysis; however, the application of these algorithms relies on the assumptions that the background noise be white and that the underlying state transitions occur at discrete times. To address these issues, we present an "H-noise" algorithm that accounts for correlated background noise and the randomness of sampling relative to transitions. We also discuss three issues that arise in the practical application of the algorithm in analyzing single channel data. First, we describe a digital inverse filter that removes the effects of the analog antialiasing filter and yields a sharp frequency roll-off. This enhances the performance while reducing the computational intensity of the algorithm. Second, the data may be contaminated with baseline drifts or deterministic interferences such as 60-Hz pickup. We propose an extension of previous results to consider baseline drift. Finally, we describe the extension of the algorithm to multiple data sets.},

abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its close congener S. paradoxus are typically indistinguishable by the phenotypic criteria of classical yeast taxonomy, but they are evolutionarily distinct as indicated by hybrid spore inviability and genomic sequence divergence. Previous work has shown that these two species coexist in oak-associated microhabitats at natural woodland sites in North America. Here, we show that sympatric populations of S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus from a single natural site are phenotypically differentiated in their growth rate responses to temperature. Our main finding is that the S. cerevisiae population exhibits a markedly higher growth rate at 37 degrees C than the S. paradoxus population; we also find possible differences in growth rate between these populations at two lower temperatures. We discuss the implications of our results for the coexistence of these yeasts in natural environments, and we suggest that thermal growth response may be an evolutionarily labile feature of these organisms that could be analyzed using genomic approaches.},

title = {The effect of selection on genealogies},
abstract = {The coalescent process can describe the effects of selection at linked loci only if selection is so strong that genotype frequencies evolve deterministically. Here, we develop methods proposed by Kaplan, Darden, and Hudson to find the effects of weak selection. We show that the overall effect is given by an extension to Price's equation: the change in properties such as moments of coalescence times is equal to the covariance between those properties and the fitness of the sample of genes. The distribution of coalescence times differs substantially between allelic classes, even in the absence of selection. However, the average coalescence time between randomly chosen genes is insensitive to the current allele frequency and is affected significantly by purifying selection only if deleterious mutations are common and selection is strong (i.e., the product of population size and selection coefficient, Ns>3). Balancing selection increases mean coalescence times, but the effect becomes large only when mutation rates between allelic classes are low and when selection is extremely strong. Our analysis supports previous simulations that show that selection has surprisingly little effect on genealogies. Moreover, small fluctuations in allele frequency due to random drift can greatly reduce any such effects. This will make it difficult to detect the action of selection from neutral variation alone.},

title = {The load dependence of kinesin's mechanical cycle},
abstract = {Kinesin is a dimeric motor protein that transports organelles in a stepwise manner toward the plus-end of microtubules by converting the energy of ATP hydrolysis into mechanical work. External forces can influence the behavior of kinesin, and force-velocity curves have shown that the motor will slow down and eventually stall under opposing loads of [approx]5 pN. Using an in vitro motility assay in conjunction with a high-resolution optical trapping microscope, we have examined the behavior of individual kinesin molecules under two previously unexplored loading regimes: super-stall loads (>5 pN) and forward (plus-end directed) loads. Whereas some theories of kinesin function predict a reversal of directionality under high loads, we found that kinesin does not walk backwards under loads of up to 13 pN, probably because of an irreversible transition in the mechanical cycle. We also found that this cycle can be significantly accelerated by forward loads under a wide range of ATP concentrations. Finally, we noted an increase in kinesin's rate of dissociation from the microtubule with increasing load, which is consistent with a load dependent partitioning between two recently described kinetic pathways: a coordinated-head pathway (which leads to stepping) and an independent-head pathway (which is static).},

title = {Quantum Noise as an Entanglement Meter},
abstract = { Entanglement entropy, which is a measure of quantum correlations between separate parts of a many-body system, has emerged recently as a fundamental quantity in broad areas of theoretical physics, from cosmology and field theory to condensed matter theory and quantum information. The universal appeal of the entanglement entropy concept is related, in part, to the fact that it is defined solely in terms of the many-body density matrix of the system, with no relation to any particular observables. However, for the same reason, it has not been clear how to access this quantity experimentally. Here we derive a universal relation between entanglement entropy and the fluctuations of current flowing through a quantum point contact (QPC) which opens a way to perform a direct measurement of entanglement entropy. In particular, by utilizing space-time duality of 1d systems, we relate electric noise generated by opening and closing the QPC periodically in time with the seminal S = 1/3 log L prediction of conformal field theory. },

title = {Structure and evolution of protein interaction networks: a statistical model for link dynamics and gene duplications},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The structure of molecular networks derives from dynamical processes on evolutionary time scales. For protein interaction networks, global statistical features of their structure can now be inferred consistently from several large-throughput datasets. Understanding the underlying evolutionary dynamics is crucial for discerning random parts of the network from biologically important properties shaped by natural selection. RESULTS: We present a detailed statistical analysis of the protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on several large-throughput datasets. Protein pairs resulting from gene duplications are used as tracers into the evolutionary past of the network. From this analysis, we infer rate estimates for two key evolutionary processes shaping the network: (i) gene duplications and (ii) gain and loss of interactions through mutations in existing proteins, which are referred to as link dynamics. Importantly, the link dynamics is asymmetric, i.e., the evolutionary steps are mutations in just one of the binding parters. The link turnover is shown to be much faster than gene duplications. Both processes are assembled into an empirically grounded, quantitative model for the evolution of protein interaction networks. CONCLUSIONS: According to this model, the link dynamics is the dominant evolutionary force shaping the statistical structure of the network, while the slower gene duplication dynamics mainly affects its size. Specifically, the model predicts (i) a broad distribution of the connectivities (i.e., the number of binding partners of a protein) and (ii) correlations between the connectivities of interacting proteins, a specific consequence of the asymmetry of the link dynamics. Both features have been observed in the protein interaction network of S. cerevisiae.},

abstract = {Duplication of genomic segments provides a primary resource for the origin of evolutionary novelties. However, most previous studies have focused on duplications of complete protein-coding genes, whereas little is known about the significance of duplication segments that are entirely internal to genes. Our examination of six fully sequenced genomes reveals that internal duplications of gene segments occur at a high frequency (0.001-0.013 duplications/gene per million years), similar to that of complete gene duplications, such that 8-17% of the genes in a genome carry duplicated intronic and/or exonic regions. At least 7-30% of such genes have acquired novel introns, either because a prior intron in the same gene has been duplicated, or more commonly, because a spatial change has activated a latent splice site. These results strongly suggest a major evolutionary role for internal gene duplications in the origin of genomic novelties, particularly as a mechanism for intron gain.},

We describe statistical and bioinformatic tools that may help identify mutations with a role in tumorigenesis. These results have implications for understanding the nature and heterogeneity of human cancers and for using personal genomics for tumor diagnosis and therapy.},

abstract = {Sequence alignment and database searching are essential tools in biology because a protein's function can often be inferred from homologous proteins. Standard sequence comparison methods use substitution matrices to find the alignment with the best sum of similarity scores between aligned residues. These similarity scores do not take the local sequence context into account. Here, we present an approach that derives context-specific amino acid similarities from short windows centered on each query sequence residue. Our results demonstrate that the sequence context contains much more information about the expected mutations than just the residue itself. By employing our context-specific similarities (CS-BLAST) in combination with NCBI BLAST, we increase the sensitivity more than 2-fold on a difficult benchmark set, without loss of speed. Alignment quality is likewise improved significantly. Furthermore, we demonstrate considerable improvements when applying this paradigm to sequence profiles: Two iterations of CSI-BLAST, our context-specific version of PSI-BLAST, are more sensitive than 5 iterations of PSI-BLAST. The paradigm for biological sequence comparison presented here is very general. It can replace substitution matrices in sequence- and profile-based alignment and search methods for both protein and nucleotide sequences.},

abstract = {We describe MUSCLE, a new computer program for creating multiple alignments of protein sequences. Elements of the algorithm include fast distance estimation using kmer counting, progressive alignment using a new profile function we call the log-expectation score, and refinement using tree-dependent restricted partitioning. The speed and accuracy of MUSCLE are compared with T-Coffee, MAFFT and CLUSTALW on four test sets of reference alignments: BAliBASE, SABmark, SMART and a new benchmark, PREFAB. MUSCLE achieves the highest, or joint highest, rank in accuracy on each of these sets. Without refinement, MUSCLE achieves average accuracy statistically indistinguishable from T-Coffee and MAFFT, and is the fastest of the tested methods for large numbers of sequences, aligning 5000 sequences of average length 350 in 7 min on a current desktop computer. The MUSCLE program, source code and PREFAB test data are freely available at http://www.drive5. com/muscle.},

title = {Endocytosis unplugged: multiple ways to enter the cell},
abstract = {Endocytosis occurs at the cell surface and involves internalization of the plasma membrane (PM) along with its constituent membrane proteins and lipids. Endocytosis is involved in sampling of the extracellular milieu and also serves to regulate various processes initiated at the cell surface. These include nutrient uptake, signaling from cell-surface receptors, and many other processes essential for cell and tissue functioning in metazoans. It is also central to the maintenance of PM lipid and protein homeostasis. There are multiple means of internalization that operate concurrently, at the cell surface. With advancement in high-resolution visualization techniques, it is now possible to track multiple endocytic cargo at the same time, revealing a remarkable diversity of endocytic processes in a single cell. A combination of live cell imaging and efficient genetic manipulations has also aided in understanding the functional hierarchy of molecular players in these mechanisms of internalization. Here we provide an account of various endocytic routes, their mechanisms of operation and occurrence across phyla.Cell Research advance online publication 2 February 2010; doi: 10.1038/cr.2010.19.},

title = {The frequency of shifts between alternative equilibria},
abstract = {We derive a formula giving the frequency with which random drift shifts a population between alternative equilibria. This formula is valid when such shifts are rare (Ns much greater than 1), and applies over a wide range of mutation rates. When the number of mutations entering the population is low (4 N mu much less than 1), the rate of stochastic shifts reduces to the product of the mutation rate and the probability of fixation of a single mutation. However, when many mutations enter the population in each generation (4 N mu much greater than 1), the rate is higher than would be expected if mutations were established independently, and converges to that given by a gaussian approximation. We apply recent results on bistable systems to extend this formula to the general multidimensional case. This gives an explicit expression for the frequency of stochastic shifts, which depends only on the equilibrium probability distribution near the saddle point separating the alternative stable states. The plausibility of theories of speciation through random drift are discussed in the light of these results.},

abstract = {A better understanding of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 drug resistance evolution under the selective pressure of combination treatment is important for the design of long-term effective treatment strategies. We applied Bayesian Network Learning to sequences from patients treated with the reverse transcriptase inhibitor combination of zidovudine and lamivudine to identify the role of many treatment-selected mutations in the development of resistance. Based on the Bayesian Network structure, an in vivo fitness landscape was build, reflecting the necessary selective pressure under treatment, to evolve naive sequences to sequences obtained from patients treated with the combination. This landscape, combined with an evolutionary model, was used to predict resistance evolution in longitudinal sequence pairs. In our analysis, mutations 41L, 70R, 184V and 215F/Y were identified as major resistance mutations to the combination of zidovudine and lamivudine, since they were directly associated with treatment experience. The network also suggested a possible role in resistance development for a number of novel mutations. Estimated fitness, using the landscape, correlated significantly with in vitro resistance phenotype in genotype-phenotype pairs (R2=0.70). Variation in predicted evolution under selective pressure correlated significantly with observed in vivo evolution during zidovudine plus lamivudine treatment. In conclusion, we confirmed current knowledge on resistance development to the combination of zidovudine and lamivudine, but additional, novel mutations were identified. Moreover, a model to predict resistance evolution during zidovudine and lamivudine treatment has been built and validated.},

title = {Genetic evidence for hybrid trait speciation in heliconius butterflies},
abstract = {Homoploid hybrid speciation is the formation of a new hybrid species without change in chromosome number. So far, there has been a lack of direct molecular evidence for hybridization generating novel traits directly involved in animal speciation. Heliconius butterflies exhibit bright aposematic color patterns that also act as cues in assortative mating. Heliconius heurippa has been proposed as a hybrid species, and its color pattern can be recreated by introgression of the H. m. melpomene red band into the genetic background of the yellow banded H. cydno cordula. This hybrid color pattern is also involved in mate choice and leads to reproductive isolation between H. heurippa and its close relatives. Here, we provide molecular evidence for adaptive introgression by sequencing genes across the Heliconius red band locus and comparing them to unlinked wing patterning genes in H. melpomene, H. cydno, and H. heurippa. 670 SNPs distributed among 29 unlinked coding genes (25,847bp) showed H. heurippa was related to H. c. cordula or the three species were intermixed. In contrast, among 344 SNPs distributed among 13 genes in the red band region (18,629bp), most showed H. heurippa related with H. c. cordula, but a block of around 6,5kb located in the 3' of a putative kinesin gene grouped H. heurippa with H. m. melpomene, supporting the hybrid introgression hypothesis. Genealogical reconstruction showed that this introgression occurred after divergence of the parental species, perhaps around 0.43Mya. Expression of the kinesin gene is spatially restricted to the distal region of the forewing, suggesting a mechanism for pattern regulation. This gene therefore constitutes the first molecular evidence for adaptive introgression during hybrid speciation and is the first clear candidate for a Heliconius wing patterning locus.},

abstract = {To investigate the relationship between meiotic crossover hot spots and block-like linkage disequilibrium (LD), we have extended our high-resolution studies of the human MHC class II region to a 90-kb segment upstream of the HLA-DOA gene. LD blocks in this region are not as well defined as in the neighboring 210-kb DNA segment but do show two regions of LD breakdown in which coalescent analysis indicates substantial historical recombination. Sperm crossover analysis of one region revealed a novel localized hot spot similar in intensity and morphology to most other MHC hot spots. Crossovers at this hot spot are not obviously affected by a large insertion/deletion polymorphism near the hot spot. The second region of LD breakdown, within the DPB1 gene, shows an extremely low level of sperm crossover activity and does not contain a sperm crossover hot spot. These results highlight the complexity of LD patterns and the importance of experimentally verifying crossover hot spots.},

abstract = {Negative epistasis in hybrid genomes commonly results in postzygotic isolation between divergent lineages. However, some genomic regions may be selectively neutral or adaptive in hybrids and thus may potentially cross species barriers. We examined postzygotic isolation between ecologically similar species of Louisiana Iris: Iris brevicaulis and I. fulva to determine the potential for adaptive introgression in nature. Line-cross analyses allowed us a general overview of the gene action responsible for fitness-related traits. We then used a QTL mapping approach to detect genomic regions responsible for variation in these traits. Although hybrid classes suffered reduced fitness for many traits, hybrid means were equivalent to at least one of the parental species in overall estimates of maternal and paternal fitness during the two years of the field study. The genetic architecture underlying the fitness-related traits varied across field site and year of the study, thus emphasizing the importance of the environment in determining the degree of postzygotic isolation and potential for introgression across natural hybrid zones.},

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ongoing screens have generated >4,800 such genetic interaction data. We demonstrate that by combining these data with information on protein-protein, prote in-DNA or metabolic networks, it is possible to uncover physical mechanisms behind many of the observed genetic effects. Using a probabilistic model, we found that 1,922 genetic interactions are significantly associated with either between- or within-pathway explanations encoded in the physical networks, covering approximately 40% of known genetic interactions. These models predict new functions for 343 proteins and suggest that between-pathway explanations are better than within-pathway explanations at interpreting genetic interactions identified in systematic screens. This study provides a road map for how genetic and physical interactions can be integrated to reveal pathway organization and function.},

abstract = {We have previously demonstrated that Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency and the relative concentration of donor and acceptor fluorophores can be determined in living cells using three-cube wide-field fluorescence microscopy. Here, we extend the methodology to estimate the effective equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) and the intrinsic FRET efficiency (E-max) of an interacting donor-acceptor pair. Assuming bimolecular interaction, the predicted FRET efficiency is a function of donor concentration, acceptor concentration, Kd, and Emax. We estimate Kd and Emax by minimizing the sum of the squared error (SSE) between the predicted and measured FRET efficiency. This is accomplished by examining the topology of SSE values for a matrix of hypothetical Kd and Emax values. Applying an F-test, the 95% confidence contour of Kd and E-max is calculated. We test the method by expressing an inducible FRET fusion pair consisting of FKBP12-Cerulean and Frb-Venus in HeLa cells. As the Kd for FKBP12-rapamycin and Frb has been analytically determined, the relative Kd (in fluorescence units) could be calibrated with a value based on protein concentration. The described methodology should be useful for comparing protein-protein interaction affinities in living cells. (C) 2007 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

title = {Unequal evolutionary rates in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) pandemic: the evolutionary rate of HIV-1 slows down when the epidemic rate increases},
abstract = {HIV-1 sequences in intravenous drug user (IDU) networks are highly homogenous even after several years, while this is not observed in most sexual epidemics. To address this disparity, we examined the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evolutionary rate on the population level for IDU and heterosexual transmissions. All available HIV-1 env V3 sequences from IDU outbreaks and heterosexual epidemics with known sampling dates were collected from the Los Alamos HIV sequence database. Evolutionary rates were calculated using phylogenetic trees with a t test root optimization of dated samples. The evolutionary rate of HIV-1 subtype A1 was found to be 8.4 times lower in fast spread among IDUs in the former Soviet Union (FSU) than in slow spread among heterosexual individuals in Africa. Mixed epidemics (IDU and heterosexual) showed intermediate evolutionary rates, indicating a combination of fast- and slow-spread patterns. Hence, if transmissions occur repeatedly during the initial stage of host infection, before selective pressures of the immune system have much impact, the rate of HIV-1 evolution on the population level will decrease. Conversely, in slow spread, where HIV-1 evolves under the pressure of the immune system before a donor infects a recipient, the virus evolution at the population level will increase. Epidemiological modeling confirmed that the evolutionary rate of HIV-1 depends on the rate of spread and predicted that the HIV-1 evolutionary rate in a fast-spreading epidemic, e.g., for IDUs in the FSU, will increase as the population becomes saturated with infections and the virus starts to spread to other risk groups.},

abstract = {Previous studies have reported that related human couples tend to produce more children than unrelated couples but have been unable to determine whether this difference is biological or stems from socioeconomic variables. Our results, drawn from all known couples of the Icelandic population born between 1800 and 1965, show a significant positive association between kinship and fertility, with the greatest reproductive success observed for couples related at the level of third and fourth cousins. Owing to the relative socioeconomic homogeneity of Icelanders, and the observation of highly significant differences in the fertility of couples separated by very fine intervals of kinship, we conclude that this association is likely to have a biological basis.},

title = {Estimating HIV evolutionary pathways and the genetic barrier to drug resistance},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The evolution of drug-resistant viruses challenges the management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. Understanding this evolutionary process is important for the design of effective therapeutic strategies. METHODS: We used mutagenetic trees, a family of probabilistic graphical models, to describe the accumulation of resistance-associated mutations in the viral genome. On the basis of these models, we defined the genetic barrier, a quantity that summarizes the difficulty for the virus to escape from the selective pressure of the drug by developing escape mutations. RESULTS: From HIV reverse-transcriptase sequences that had been obtained from treated patients, we derived evolutionary models for zidovudine, zidovudine plus lamivudine, and zidovudine plus didanosine. The genetic barriers to resistance to zidovudine, stavudine, lamivudine, and didanosine, for the above 3 regimens, were computed and analyzed. We found both the mode and the rate of development of resistance to be heterogeneous. The genetic barrier to zidovudine resistance was increased if lamivudine was added to zidovudine but was decreased for didanosine. The barrier to lamivudine resistance was maintained with zidovudine plus didanosine, whereas the barrier to didanosine resistance was reduced most with zidovudine plus lamivudine. CONCLUSION: Mutagenetic trees provide a quantitative picture of the evolution of drug resistance. The genetic barrier is a useful tool for design of effective treatment strategies.},

abstract = {Immune control of HIV often fails due to viral escape from cellular and humoral host immune responses. Vaccine development is a daunting task because of the ability of HIV to adapt rapidly to different selection pressures and quickly restore viral fitness when transmitted to new hosts. In addition, the global viral diversity poses significant difficulties for accurate and standardized testing of immune responses in the infected host, slowing the generation of data that are crucial to defining relevant immune correlates of controlled HIV infection. Many recent studies have shed light on some of the potentially important factors of protective immune responses and have provided further insight into the viral kinetics determining immune control, viral adaptation, and immune escape. This knowledge will likely further guide the design of broadly applicable HIV vaccine candidates.},

title = {A galaxy of folds},
abstract = {Many protein classification systems capture homologous relationships by grouping domains into families and superfamilies on the basis of sequence similarity. Superfamilies with similar 3D structures are further grouped into folds. In the absence of discernable sequence similarity, these structural similarities were long thought to have originated independently, by convergent evolution. However, the growth of databases and advances in sequence comparison methods have led to the discovery of many distant evolutionary relationships that transcend the boundaries of superfamilies and folds. To investigate the contributions of convergent versus divergent evolution in the origin of protein folds, we clustered representative domains of known structure by their sequence similarity, treating them as point masses in a virtual 2D space which attract or repel each other depending on their pairwise sequence similarities. As expected, families in the same superfamily form tight clusters. But often, superfamilies of the same fold are linked with each other, suggesting that the entire fold evolved from an ancient prototype. Strikingly, some links connect superfamilies with different folds. They arise from modular peptide fragments of between 20 and 40 residues that co-occur in the connected folds in disparate structural contexts. These may be descendants of an ancestral pool of peptide modules that evolved as cofactors in the RNA world and from which the first folded proteins arose by amplification and recombination. Our galaxy of folds summarizes, in a single image, most known and many yet undescribed homologous relationships between protein superfamilies, providing new insights into the evolution of protein domains.},

title = {Population genetics of polymorphism and divergence under fluctuating selection},
abstract = {Current methods for detecting fluctuating selection require time series data on genotype frequencies. Here, we propose an alternative approach that makes use of DNA polymorphism data from a sample of individuals collected at a single point in time. Our method uses classical diffusion approximations to model temporal fluctuations in the selection coefficients to find the expected distribution of mutation frequencies in the population. Using the Poisson random-field setting we derive the site-frequency spectrum (SFS) for three different models of fluctuating selection. We find that the general effect of fluctuating selection is to produce a more "U"-shaped site-frequency spectrum with an excess of high-frequency derived mutations at the expense of middle-frequency variants. We present likelihood-ratio tests, comparing the fluctuating selection models to the neutral model using SFS data, and use Monte Carlo simulations to assess their power. We find that we have sufficient power to reject a neutral hypothesis using samples on the order of a few hundred SNPs and a sample size of approximately 20 and power to distinguish between selection that varies in time and constant selection for a sample of size 20. We also find that fluctuating selection increases the probability of fixation of selected sites even if, on average, there is no difference in selection among a pair of alleles segregating at the locus. Fluctuating selection will, therefore, lead to an increase in the ratio of divergence to polymorphism similar to that observed under positive directional selection.},

title = {The dominance theory of Haldane's rule},
abstract = {"HALDANE's rule" states that, if species hybrids of one sex only are inviable or sterile, the afflicted sex is much more likely to be heterogametic (XY) than homogametic (XX). We show that most or all of the phenomena associated with HALDANE's rule can be explained by the simple hypothesis that alleles decreasing hybrid fitness are partially recessive. Under this hypothesis, the XY sex suffers more than the XX because X-linked alleles causing postzygotic isolation tend to have greater cumulative effects when hemizygous than when heterozygous, even though the XX sex carries twice as many such alleles. The dominance hypothesis can also account for the "large X effect," the disproportionate effect of the X chromosome on hybrid inviability/sterility. In addition, the dominance theory is consistent with: the long temporal lag between the evolution of heterogametic and homogametic postzygotic isolation, the frequency of exceptions to HALDANE's rule, puzzling Drosophila experiments in which "unbalanced" hybrid females, who carry two X chromosomes from the same species, remain fertile whereas F1 hybrid males are sterile, and the absence of cases of HALDANE's rule for hybrid inviability in mammals. We discuss several novel predictions that could lead to rejection of the dominance theory.},

Furthermore, missense changes at 12 of the experimental sites were at residues differing between the parental phages; in ten cases the phiX174 experimental lineages were convergent with the S13 parent, or vice versa, at both the nucleotide and amino-acid levels. Convergence at a site was even obtained in both directions in three cases.

title = {Electrostatic mechanism of nucleosomal array folding revealed by computer simulation},
abstract = {Although numerous experiments indicate that the chromatin fiber displays salt-dependent conformations, the associated molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we apply an irregular Discrete Surface Charge Optimization (DiSCO) model of the nucleosome with all histone tails incorporated to describe by Monte Carlo simulations salt-dependent rearrangements of a nucleosomal array with 12 nucleosomes. The ensemble of nucleosomal array conformations display salt-dependent condensation in good agreement with hydrodynamic measurements and suggest that the array adopts highly irregular 3D zig-zag conformations at high (physiological) salt concentrations and transitions into the extended "beads-on-a-string" conformation at low salt. Energy analyses indicate that the repulsion among linker DNA leads to this extended form, whereas internucleosome attraction drives the folding at high salt. The balance between these two contributions determines the salt-dependent condensation. Importantly, the internucleosome and linker DNA-nucleosome attractions require histone tails; we find that the H3 tails, in particular, are crucial for stabilizing the moderately folded fiber at physiological monovalent salt.},

title = {Evolutionary interactions between N-linked glycosylation sites in the HIV-1 envelope},
abstract = {The addition of asparagine (N)-linked polysaccharide chains (i.e., glycans) to the gp120 and gp41 glycoproteins of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope is not only required for correct protein folding, but also may provide protection against neutralizing antibodies as a "glycan shield." As a result, strong host-specific selection is frequently associated with codon positions where nonsynonymous substitutions can create or disrupt potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGSs). Moreover, empirical data suggest that the individual contribution of PNGSs to the neutralization sensitivity or infectivity of HIV-1 may be critically dependent on the presence or absence of other PNGSs in the envelope sequence. Here we evaluate how glycan-glycan interactions have shaped the evolution of HIV-1 envelope sequences by analyzing the distribution of PNGSs in a large-sequence alignment. Using a "covarion"-type phylogenetic model, we find that the rates at which individual PNGSs are gained or lost vary significantly over time, suggesting that the selective advantage of having a PNGS may depend on the presence or absence of other PNGSs in the sequence. Consequently, we identify specific interactions between PNGSs in the alignment using a new paired-character phylogenetic model of evolution, and a Bayesian graphical model. Despite the fundamental differences between these two methods, several interactions are jointly identified by both. Mapping these interactions onto a structural model of HIV-1 gp120 reveals that negative (exclusive) interactions occur significantly more often between colocalized glycans, while positive (inclusive) interactions are restricted to more distant glycans. Our results imply that the adaptive repertoire of alternative configurations in the HIV-1 glycan shield is limited by functional interactions between the N-linked glycans. This represents a potential vulnerability of rapidly evolving HIV-1 populations that may provide useful glycan-based targets for neutralizing antibodies.},

title = {Modeling sequence evolution in acute HIV-1 infection},
abstract = {We describe a mathematical model and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of viral evolution during acute infection. We consider both synchronous and asynchronous processes of viral infection of new target cells. The model enables an assessment of the expected sequence diversity in new HIV-1 infections originating from a single transmitted viral strain, estimation of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the transmitted viral lineage, and estimation of the time to coalesce back to the MRCA. We also calculate the probability of the MRCA being the transmitted virus or an evolved variant. Excluding insertions and deletions, we assume HIV-1 evolves by base substitution without selection pressure during the earliest phase of HIV-1 infection prior to the immune response. Unlike phylogenetic methods that follow a lineage backwards to coalescence, we compare the observed data to a model of the diversification of a viral population forward in time. To illustrate the application of these methods, we provide detailed comparisons of the model and simulations results to 306 envelope sequences obtained from eight newly infected subjects at a single time point. The data from 68 patients were in good agreement with model predictions, and hence compatible with a single-strain infection evolving under no selection pressure. The diversity of the samples from the other two patients was too great to be explained by the model, suggesting multiple HIV-1-strains were transmitted. The model can also be applied to longitudinal patient data to estimate within-host viral evolutionary parameters.},

title = {Frequency- and Density-Dependent Selection on a Quantitative Character},
abstract = {The equilibrium distribution of a quantitative character subject to frequency- and density-dependent selection is found under different assumptions about the genetical basis of the character that lead to a normal distribution in a population. Three types of models are considered: (1) one-locus models, in which a single locus has an additive effect on the character, (2) continuous genotype models, in which one locus or several loci contribute additively to a character, and there is an effectively infinite range of values of the genotypic contributions from each locus, and (3) correlation models, in which the mean and variance of the character can change only through selection at modifier loci. It is shown that the second and third models lead to the same equilibrium values of the total population size and the mean and variance of the character. One-locus models lead to different equilibrium values because of constraints on the relationship between the mean and variance imposed by the assumptions of those models.--The main conclusion is that, at the equilibrium reached under frequency- and density-dependent selection, the distribution of a normally distributed quantitative character does not depend on the underlying genetic model as long as the model imposes no constraints on the mean and variance.},

We first aligned the genomes and characterized their evolution, defining the regions and mechanisms of change. We then developed methods for direct identification of genes and regulatory motifs. The gene analysis yielded a major revision to the yeast gene catalogue, affecting approximately 15% of all genes and reducing the total count by about 500 genes. The motif analysis automatically identified 72 genome-wide elements, including most known regulatory motifs and numerous new motifs. We inferred a putative function for most of these motifs, and provided insights into their combinatorial interactions. The results have implications for genome analysis of diverse organisms, including the human.},

abstract = {An approximate equation is derived, which predicts the effect on variability at a neutral locus of background selection due to a set of partly linked deleterious mutations. Random mating, multiplicative fitnesses, and sufficiently large population size that the selected loci are in mutation/selection equilibrium are assumed. Given these assumptions, the equation is valid for an arbitrary genetic map, and for an arbitrary distribution of selection coefficients across loci. Monte Carlo computer simulations show that the formula performs well for small population sizes under a wide range of conditions, and even seems to apply when there are epistatic fitness interactions among the selected loci. Failure occurred only with very weak selection and tight linkage. The formula is shown to imply that weakly selected mutations are more likely than strongly selected mutations to produce regional patterning of variability along a chromosome in response to local variation in recombination rates. Loci at the extreme tip of a chromosome experience a smaller effect of background selection than loci closer to the centre. It is shown that background selection can produce a considerable overall reduction in variation in organisms with small numbers of chromosomes and short maps, such as Drosophila. Large overall effects are less likely in species with higher levels of genetic recombination, such as mammals, although local reductions in regions of reduced recombination might be detectable.},

title = {Feature Article: Elicitation of structure-specific antibodies by epitope scaffolds},
abstract = {Elicitation of antibodies against targets that are immunorecessive, cryptic, or transient in their native context has been a challenge for vaccine design. Here we demonstrate the elicitation of structure-specific antibodies against the HIV-1 gp41 epitope of the broadly neutralizing antibody 2F5. This conformationally flexible region of gp41 assumes mostly helical conformations but adopts a kinked, extended structure when bound by antibody 2F5. Computational techniques were employed to transplant the 2F5 epitope into select acceptor scaffolds. The resultant "2F5-epitope scaffolds" possessed nanomolar affinity for antibody 2F5 and a range of epitope flexibilities and antigenic specificities. Crystallographic characterization of the epitope scaffold with highest affinity and antigenic discrimination confirmed good to near perfect attainment of the target conformation for the gp41 molecular graft in free and 2F5-bound states, respectively. Animals immunized with 2F5-epitope scaffolds showed levels of graft-specific immune responses that correlated with graft flexibility (p < 0.04), while antibody responses against the graft-as dissected residue-by-residue with alanine substitutions-resembled more closely those of 2F5 than sera elicited with flexible or cyclized peptides, a resemblance heightened by heterologous prime-boost. Lastly, crystal structures of a gp41 peptide in complex with monoclonal antibodies elicited by the 2F5-epitope scaffolds revealed that the elicited antibodies induce gp41 to assume its 2F5-recognized shape. Epitope scaffolds thus provide a means to elicit antibodies that recognize a predetermined target shape and sequence, even if that shape is transient in nature, and a means by which to dissect factors influencing such elicitation.},

abstract = {Reproductive strategies such as sexual reproduction and recombination that involve the shuffling of parental genomes for the production of offspring are ubiquitous in nature. However, their evolutionary benefit remains unclear. Many theories have identified potential benefits, but progress is hampered by the scarcity of relevant data. One class of theories is based on the assumption that mutations affecting fitness exhibit negative epistasis. Retroviruses recombine frequently and thus provide a unique opportunity to test these theories. Using amino acid sequence data and fitness values from 9466 human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) isolates, we find in contrast to these theories strong statistical evidence for a predominance of positive epistasis in HIV-1.},

abstract = {The role that natural selection plays in governing the locations and early evolution of copy-number mutations remains largely unexplored. We used high-density full-genome tiling arrays to create a fine-scale genomic map of copy-number polymorphisms (CNPs) in Drosophila melanogaster. We inferred a total of 2658 independent CNPs, 56% of which overlap genes. These include CNPs that are likely to be under positive selection, most notably high-frequency duplications encompassing toxin-response genes. The locations and frequencies of CNPs are strongly shaped by purifying selection, with deletions under stronger purifying selection than duplications. Among duplications, those overlapping exons or introns, as well as those falling on the X chromosome, seem to be subject to stronger purifying selection.},

The differential equation may be obtained from a mutation-recombination model with discrete generations, in the limit of short generations, or weak mutation and recombination. The solution relies on the multilinear structure of the dynamical system, and on the commuting properties of the mutation and recombination operators. It is obtained through diagonalization of the mutation term, followed by a transformation to certain measures of linkage disequilibrium that simultaneously linearize and diagonalize the recombination dynamics. The collection of linkage disequilibria, as well as their decay rates, are given in closed form.},

title = {GENETIC SLIPPAGE IN RESPONSE TO SEX},
abstract = {It is widely held that sexual reproduction enhances the potential for evolution by expanding the range of variation on which selection can act. However, when nonadditive gene action contributes to the expression of traits under selection, sexual reproduction can also result in slippage of the mean genotypic value in the direction contrary to selection. We show how the magnitude of genetic slippage depends on the extent to which segregation and recombination create maladapted genotypes. We also show how random mating can induce a change in the expressed genetic variance for a quantitative trait by eliminating Hardy-Weinberg disequilibria and reducing gametic-phase disequilibria. Depending on whether genes of like effects are in repulsion or coupling disequilibrium, this change will be positive or negative. Thus, depending on the mode of gene action and the form of the selection function, sexual reproduction can either enhance or impede the short-term response of quantitative characters to selection. Although this issue is relevant to all sexual populations, it is most easily investigated in species that infrequently engage in sex, since prolonged phases of clonal propagation can greatly exaggerate genetic disequilibria. We describe a population of the cyclical parthenogen Daphnia pulex in which sexual reproduction induced average changes in the means of life-history characters equivalent to approximately one-tenth of a phenotypic standard deviation. Contrary to the usual expectation, sex also caused a significant reduction in the expressed genetic variance for several traits in this population. A large fraction of the genetic variance in Daphnia appears to be due to dominance, and in the study population, clonal selection appears to cause a buildup of coupling disequilibrium between genes and gene combinations of like effects.},

abstract = {Evolution at a multiallelic locus under the joint action of migration and viability selection is investigated. Generations are discrete and nonoverlapping. The monoecious, diploid population is subdivided into finitely many panmictic colonies that exchange adult migrants independently of genotype. The forward migration matrix is arbitrary, but time independent and ergodic (i.e., irreducible and aperiodic). Several examples of globally attracting multiallelic equilibria are presented. Migration can cause global fixation even if, without migration, there is a globally attracting multiallelic equilibrium in every colony. Migration can also cause the global fixation of an allele that, without migration, is eliminated in every colony. Without dominance, generically, the number of alleles present at equilibrium cannot exceed the number of colonies. Some general properties and examples of the Levene model are studied in detail. If in each colony there is either no dominance or, without migration, a globally attracting internal equilibrium, then there exists a globally attracting equilibrium with migration. Therefore, if an internal equilibrium exists, it is the global attractor.},

abstract = {In this report, we investigate the statistical power of several tests of selective neutrality based on patterns of genetic diversity within and between species. The goal is to compare tests based solely on population genetic data with tests using comparative data or a combination of comparative and population genetic data. We show that in the presence of repeated selective sweeps on relatively neutral background, tests based on the d(N)/d(S) ratios in comparative data almost always have more power to detect selection than tests based on population genetic data, even if the overall level of divergence is low. Tests based solely on the distribution of allele frequencies or the site frequency spectrum, such as the Ewens-Watterson test or Tajima's D, have less power in detecting both positive and negative selection because of the transient nature of positive selection and the weak signal left by negative selection. The Hudson-Kreitman-Aguad{\'e} test is the most powerful test for detecting positive selection among the population genetic tests investigated, whereas McDonald-Kreitman test typically has more power to detect negative selection. We discuss our findings in the light of the discordant results obtained in several recently published genomic scans.},

Recent linkage disequilibrium (LD) and sperm-typing studies suggest that recombination rates vary tremendously across the human genome, with most events occurring in narrow "hotspots." To examine variation in fine-scale recombination patterns among individuals, we used dense, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism data collected in nuclear families to localize crossovers with high spatial resolution. This analysis revealed that overall recombination hotspot usage is similar in males and females, with individual hotspots often active in both sexes. Across the genome, roughly 60% of crossovers occurred in hotspots inferred from LD studies. Notably, however, we found extensive and heritable variation among both males and females in the proportion of crossovers occurring in these hotspots.},

title = {YEAST EVOLUTION AND COMPARATIVE GENOMICS},
abstract = {AbstractRecent sequencing efforts and experiments have advanced our understanding of genome evolution in yeasts, particularly the Saccharomyces yeasts. The ancestral genome of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto complex has been subject to both whole-genome duplication, followed by massive sequence loss and divergence, and segmental duplication. In addition the subtelomeric regions are subject to further duplications and rearrangements via ectopic exchanges. Translocations and other gross chromosomal rearrangements that break down syntenic relationships occur; however, they do not appear to be a driving force of speciation. Analysis of single genomes has been fruitful for hypothesis generation such as the whole-genome duplication, but comparative genomics between close and more distant species has proven to be a powerful tool in testing these hypotheses as well as elucidating evolutionary processes acting on the genome.

title = {Improved prediction of response to antiretroviral combination therapy using the genetic barrier to drug resistance},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The outcome of antiretroviral combination therapy depends on many factors involving host, virus, and drugs. We investigate prediction of treatment response from the applied drug combination and the genetic constellation of the virus population at baseline. The virus's evolutionary potential for escaping from drug pressure is explored as an additional predictor. METHODS: We compare different encodings of the viral genotype and antiretroviral regimen including phenotypic and evolutionary information, namely predicted phenotypic drug resistance, activity of the regimen estimated from sequence space search, the genetic barrier to drug resistance, and the genetic progression score. These features were evaluated in the context of different statistical learning procedures applied to the binary classification task of predicting virological response. Classifier performance was evaluated using cross-validation and receiver operating characteristic curves on 6,337 observed treatment change episodes from the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database and a large US clinic-based patient population. RESULTS: We find that the choice of appropriate features affects predictive performance more profoundly than the choice of the statistical learning method. Application of the genetic barrier to drug resistance, which combines phenotypic and evolutionary information, outperformed the genetic progression score, which uses exclusively evolutionary knowledge. The benefit of phenotypic information in predicting virological response was confirmed by using predicted fold changes in drug susceptibility. Moreover, genetic barrier and predicted phenotypic drug resistance were found to be the best encodings across all datasets and statistical learning methods examined.

abstract = {We present a strategy for generating and analyzing comprehensive genetic-interaction maps, termed E-MAPs (epistatic miniarray profiles), comprising quantitative measures of aggravating or alleviating interactions between gene pairs. Crucial to the interpretation of E-MAPs is their high-density nature made possible by focusing on logically connected gene subsets and including essential genes. Described here is the analysis of an E-MAP of genes acting in the yeast early secretory pathway. Hierarchical clustering, together with novel analytical strategies and experimental verification, revealed or clarified the role of many proteins involved in extensively studied processes such as sphingolipid metabolism and retention of HDEL proteins. At a broader level, analysis of the E-MAP delineated pathway organization and components of physical complexes and illustrated the interconnection between the various secretory processes. Extension of this strategy to other logically connected gene subsets in yeast and higher eukaryotes should provide critical insights into the functional/organizational principles of biological systems.},

title = {Increasing sequence correlation limits the efficiency of recombination in a multisite evolution model},
abstract = {The accumulation of preexisting beneficial alleles in a haploid population, under selection and infrequent recombination, and in the absence of new mutation events is studied numerically by means of detailed Monte Carlo simulations. On the one hand, we confirm our previous work, in that the accumulation rate follows modified single-site kinetics, with a timescale set by an effective selection coefficient s(eff) as shown in a previous work, and we confirm the qualitative features of the dependence of s(eff) on the population size and the recombination rate reported therein. In particular, we confirm the existence of a threshold population size below which evolution stops before the emergence of best-fit individuals. On the other hand, our simulations reveal that the population dynamics is essentially shaped by the steady accumulation of pairwise sequence correlation, causing sequence congruence in excess of what one would expect from a uniformly random distribution of alleles. By sequence congruence, we understand here the opposite of genetic distance, that is, the fraction of monomorphic sites of specified allele type in a pair of genomes (individual sequences). The effective selection coefficient changes more rapidly with the recombination rate and has a higher threshold in this parameter than found in the previous work, which neglected correlation effects. We examine this phenomenon by monitoring the time dependence of sequence correlation based on a set of sequence congruence measures and verify that it is not associated with the development of linkage disequilibrium. We also discuss applications to HIV evolution in infected individuals and potential implications for drug therapy.},

title = {Recombination and the divergence of hybridizing species},
abstract = {The interplay between hybridization and recombination can have a dramatic effect on the likelihood of speciation or persistence of incompletely isolated species. Many models have suggested recombination can oppose speciation, and several recent empirical investigations suggest that reductions in recombination between various components of reproductive isolation and/or adaptation can allow species to persist in the presence of gene flow. In this article, we discuss these ideas in relation to speciation models, phylogenetic analyses, and species concepts. In particular, we revisit genetic architectures and population mechanisms that create genetic correlations and facilitate divergence in the face of gene flow. Linkage among genes contributing to adaptation or reproductive isolation due to chromosomal rearrangements as well as pleiotropy or proximity of loci can greatly increase the odds of species divergence or persistence. Finally, we recommend recombination to be a focus of inquiry when studying the origins of biological diversity.},

abstract = {After acute HIV infection, CD8(+) T cells are able to control viral replication to a set point. This control is often lost after superinfection, although the mechanism behind this remains unclear. In this study, we illustrate in an HLA-B27(+) subject that loss of viral control after HIV superinfection coincides with rapid recombination events within two narrow regions of Gag and Env. Screening for CD8(+) T cell responses revealed that each of these recombination sites (approximately 50 aa) encompassed distinct regions containing two immunodominant CD8 epitopes (B27-KK10 in Gag and Cw1-CL9 in Env). Viral escape and the subsequent development of variant-specific de novo CD8(+) T cell responses against both epitopes were illustrative of the significant immune selection pressures exerted by both responses. Comprehensive analysis of the kinetics of CD8 responses and viral evolution indicated that the recombination events quickly facilitated viral escape from both dominant WT- and variant-specific responses. These data suggest that the ability of a superinfecting strain of HIV to overcome preexisting immune control may be related to its ability to rapidly recombine in critical regions under immune selection pressure. These data also support a role for cellular immune pressures in driving the selection of new recombinant forms of HIV.},

title = {Experimental evolution of mating discrimination in budding yeast},
abstract = {Assortative mating, when individuals of similar phenotypes mate, likely plays a key role in preventing gene flow during speciation. Reinforcement occurs when two previously geographically separated (allopatric) groups meet after having evolved partial postzygotic isolation; they are selected to evolve or enhance assortative mating to prevent costly intergroup matings that produce only maladaptive or sterile hybrids. Studies in Drosophila have shown that the genetic architectures of mating discrimination could differ significantly with or without reinforcement, suggesting that the evolution of assortative mating may be more complicated than expected. To study the evolution of assortative mating, we evolved mating discrimination in populations of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. After 36 cycles of selection, these cells are five times more likely to mate with each other than to their ancestors, despite detectable one-way gene flow between the selected and reference populations. Several individual cultures evolved mating discrimination by changing their mating kinetics, with some mating more rapidly and others more slowly than the ancestral population. Genetic analysis indicates that multiple mutations have accumulated to produce the altered mating preference. Our results show that subtle details of mating behavior can play an important role in the evolution of reproductive isolation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A fundamental question in comparative genomics concerns the identification of mechanisms that underpin chromosomal change. In an attempt to shed light on the dynamics of mammalian genome evolution, we analyzed the distribution of syntenic blocks, evolutionary breakpoint regions, and evolutionary breakpoints taken from public databases available for seven eutherian species (mouse, rat, cattle, dog, pig, cat, and horse) and the chicken, and examined these for correspondence with human fragile sites and tandem repeats. RESULTS: Our results confirm previous investigations that showed the presence of chromosomal regions in the human genome that have been repeatedly used as illustrated by a high breakpoint accumulation in certain chromosomes and chromosomal bands. We show, however, that there is a striking correspondence between fragile site location, the positions of evolutionary breakpoints, and the distribution of tandem repeats throughout the human genome, which similarly reflect a non-uniform pattern of occurrence. CONCLUSION: These observations provide further evidence that certain chromosomal regions in the human genome have been repeatedly used in the evolutionary process. As a consequence, the genome is a composite of fragile regions prone to reorganization that have been conserved in different lineages, and genomic tracts that do not exhibit the same levels of evolutionary plasticity.},

abstract = {In this paper, we examine the conditions that allow increased recombination to evolve in the presence of recurrent deleterious mutation. We focus on a three-locus model first studied by Feldman et al. (1980), which follows the dynamics of a modifier locus that alters the recombination rate between two loci subject to deleterious mutation. Although Feldman et al. (1980) indicated that increased recombination might be favored if there is diminishing-returns epistasis, we show that alleles that increase the recombination rate can only invade if there is synergistic epistasis between the loci under selection. Even with synergistic epistasis, evolution at the modifier locus will lead to decreased recombination if the modifier locus is loosely linked and epistasis is strong. Using the multi-locus analysis of Barton (1995), we show that variability among loci in the sign and strength of epistasis further decreases the parameter space over which increased recombination may evolve. We conclude that, even with negative epistasis, increased recombination may only be favored when linkage is tight, especially if, as seems likely, epistatic interactions are highly variable among loci.},

title = {The effect of sex on adaptation to high temperature in heterozygous and homozygous yeast},
abstract = {Most explanations for the evolutionary maintenance of sex depend on the assumption that sex produces variation by recombining parental haplotypes in the offspring. Therefore, meiosis is expected to be useful only in heterozygotes. We tested this assumption by competing sexual strains of yeast against constitutive asexuals in a hot (37 degrees C) culture for 500 generations, in either heterozygous or homozygous genetic backgrounds. We found that there was an initial cost of sex for all the sexual strains, which was indicated by a sharp increase in the proportion of asexuals after the induction of sex. The cost was larger in the heterozygotes than in the homozygotes, probably because of recombinational load. However, in two of the three heterozygote backgrounds, after the initial success of the asexuals, the remaining sexuals eventually drove them out of the population. These two heterozygotes also suffered the largest initial cost of sex. In the other heterozygote and in the three homozygote backgrounds it appeared to be a matter of chance whether sexuals or asexuals won. The average relative fitness increased in all the strains, but the increase was largest in the two strains that showed both the clearest advantage and the largest cost of sex. We conclude that these results are consistent with the traditional view that sex has a short-term cost but a long-term benefit.},

title = {Positive selection at sites of multiple amino acid replacements since rat-mouse divergence},
abstract = {New alleles become fixed owing to random drift of nearly neutral mutations or to positive selection of substantially advantageous mutations. After decades of debate, the fraction of fixations driven by selection remains uncertain. Within 9,390 genes, we analysed 28,196 codons at which rat and mouse differ from each other at two nucleotide sites and 1,982 codons with three differences. At codons where rat-mouse divergence involved two non-synonymous substitutions, both of them occurred in the same lineage, either rat or mouse, in 64% of cases; however, independent substitutions would occur in the same lineage with a probability of only 50%. All three non-synonymous substitutions occurred in the same lineage for 46% of codons, instead of the 25% expected. Furthermore, comparison of 12 pairs of prokaryotic genomes also shows clumping of multiple non-synonymous substitutions in the same lineage. This pattern cannot be explained by correlated mutation or episodes of relaxed negative selection, but instead indicates that positive selection acts at many sites of rapid, successive amino acid replacement.},

title = {Detection of low-frequency pretherapy chemokine (CXC motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4)-using {HIV}-1 with ultra-deep pyrosequencing},
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Identification of low-frequency variants is of clinical importance in the identification of preexisting drug resistance. Using 'ultra-deep' sequencing, we address the detection of potential resistance to the chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) antagonist, maraviroc, due to the pretreatment presence of low levels of chemokine (CXC motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4)-using virus. METHODS: We present a novel protocol for the phenotyping of HIV based on '454' pyrosequence data and apply this to two large data sets comprised of 104 628 (before treatment, day 1) and 191 637 (after treatment, day 11) reads from the envelope region. We study resistance in the context of the evolutionary history of the intrapatient viral population. Variation was also investigated both within and outside the V3 region, the region associated with the receptor switch. RESULTS: CXCR4-using virus can be detected at low frequency prior to maraviroc treatment ( approximately 0.5%) and at high frequency after failure of monotherapy ( approximately 81%). Inferring an evolutionary tree from the 1674 unique reads that span the V3 region confirms that the CXCR4-using population emerged from low-frequency CXCR4-using variants present before treatment. Changes in the frequency of amino acid residues used at individual sites were found in regions outside the V3 region, indicative of other potential sites associated with receptor usage. CONCLUSION: We have provided a high-resolution snapshot of intrapatient viral variation, prior and after treatment with maraviroc, and detected preexisting CXCR4-using variants present at an extremely low frequency. The evolutionary analysis demonstrates the extent of diversity present at a single time point within an infected individual and the rapid effect of drug pressure on the structure of a viral population.},

abstract = {We have investigated the rate of substitution of advantageous mutations in populations of haploid organisms where the rate of recombination can be controlled. We have verified that in all the situations recombination speeds up adaptation through recombination of beneficial mutations from distinct lineages in a single individual, and so reducing the intensity of clonal interference. The advantage of sex for adaptation is even stronger when deleterious mutations occur since now recombination can also restore genetic background free of deleterious mutations. However, our simulation results demonstrate that evidence of clonal interference, as increased mean selective effect of fixed mutations and reduced likelihood of fixation of small-effect mutations, are also present in sexual populations. What we see is that this evidence is delayed when compared to asexual populations.},

In an analysis of 1930 pneumococcal genotypes from six housekeeping genes and 94 genotypes from related species, we identified mosaic genotypes representing admixture between populations and found that these were significantly associated with resistance to several classes of antibiotics. We hypothesize that these observations result from a history of hyper-recombination, which means that these strains are more likely to acquire both divergent genetic material and resistance determinants. This could have consequences for the reemergence of drug resistance after pneumococcal vaccination and also for our understanding of diversification and speciation in recombinogenic bacteria.},

title = {Order and stochastic dynamics in Drosophila planar cell polarity},
abstract = {Cells in the wing blade of Drosophila melanogaster exhibit an in-plane polarization causing distal orientation of hairs. Establishment of the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) involves intercellular interactions as well as a global orienting signal. Many of the genetic and molecular components underlying this process have been experimentally identified and a recently advanced system-level model has suggested that the observed mutant phenotypes can be understood in terms of intercellular interactions involving asymmetric localization of membrane bound proteins. Among key open questions in understanding the emergence of ordered polarization is the effect of stochasticity and the role of the global orienting signal. These issues relate closely to our understanding of ferromagnetism in physical systems. Here we pursue this analogy to understand the emergence of PCP order. To this end we develop a semi-phenomenological representation of the underlying molecular processes and define a "phase diagram" of the model which provides a global view of the dependence of the phenotype on parameters. We show that the dynamics of PCP has two regimes: rapid growth in the amplitude of local polarization followed by a slower process of alignment which progresses from small to large scales. We discuss the response of the tissue to various types of orienting signals and show that global PCP order can be achieved with a weak orienting signal provided that it acts during the early phase of the process. Finally we define and discuss some of the experimental predictions of the model.},

title = {DNA as a programmable viscoelastic nanoelement},
abstract = {The two strands of a DNA molecule with a repetitive sequence can pair into many different basepairing patterns. For perfectly periodic sequences, early bulk experiments of P{\"o}rschke indicate the existence of a sliding process, permitting the rapid transition between different relative strand positions. Here, we use a detailed theoretical model to study the basepairing dynamics of periodic and nearly periodic DNA. As suggested by P{\"o}rschke, DNA sliding is mediated by basepairing defects (bulge loops), which can diffuse along the DNA. Moreover, a shear force f on opposite ends of the two strands yields a characteristic dynamic response: An outward average sliding velocity v approximately 1/N is induced in a double strand of length N, provided f is larger than a threshold fc. Conversely, if the strands are initially misaligned, they realign even against an external force f < fc. These dynamics effectively result in a viscoelastic behavior of DNA under shear forces, with properties that are programmable through the choice of the DNA sequence. We find that a small number of mutations in periodic sequences does not prevent DNA sliding, but introduces a time delay in the dynamic response. We clarify the mechanism for the time delay and describe it quantitatively within a phenomenological model. Based on our findings, we suggest new dynamical roles for DNA in artificial nanoscale devices. The basepairing dynamics described here is also relevant for the extension of repetitive sequences inside genomic DNA.},

abstract = {The most highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) in mammalian genomes cluster within regions enriched for genes encoding developmentally important transcription factors (TFs). This suggests that HCNE-rich regions may contain key regulatory controls involved in development. We explored this by examining histone methylation in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells across 56 large HCNE-rich loci. We identified a specific modification pattern, termed "bivalent domains," consisting of large regions of H3 lysine 27 methylation harboring smaller regions of H3 lysine 4 methylation. Bivalent domains tend to coincide with TF genes expressed at low levels. We propose that bivalent domains silence developmental genes in ES cells while keeping them poised for activation. We also found striking correspondences between genome sequence and histone methylation in ES cells, which become notably weaker in differentiated cells. These results highlight the importance of DNA sequence in defining the initial epigenetic landscape and suggest a novel chromatin-based mechanism for maintaining pluripotency.},

title = {Invasion and maintenance of dengue virus type 2 and type 4 in the Americas},
abstract = {Dengue virus type 4 (DENV-4) was first reported in the Americas in 1981, where it caused epidemics of dengue fever throughout the region. In the same year, the region's first epidemic of dengue hemorrhagic fever was reported, caused by an Asian strain of dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) that was distinct from the American subtype circulating previously. Despite the importance of these epidemics, little is known about the rates or determinants of viral spread among island and mainland populations or their directions of movement. We employed a Bayesian coalescent approach to investigate the transmission histories of DENV-2 and DENV-4 since their introduction in 1981 and a parsimony method to assess patterns of strain migration. For both viruses there was an initial invasion phase characterized by an exponential increase in the number of DENV lineages, after which levels of genetic diversity remained constant despite reported fluctuations in DENV-2 and DENV-4 activity. Strikingly, viral lineage numbers increased far more rapidly for DENV-4 than DENV-2, indicative of a more rapid rate of exponential population growth in DENV-4 or a higher rate of geographic dispersal, allowing this virus to move more effectively among localities. We propose that these contrasting dynamics may reflect underlying differences in patterns of host immunity. Despite continued gene flow along particular transmission routes, the overall extent of viral traffic was less than expected under panmixis. Hence, DENV in the Americas has a clear geographic structure that maintains viral diversity between outbreaks.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is essential for normal development and has been implicated in many pathologies including cancer. Our knowledge about the genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation, how it changes during cellular differentiation and how it relates to histone methylation and other chromatin modifications in mammals remains limited. Here we report the generation and analysis of genome-scale DNA methylation profiles at nucleotide resolution in mammalian cells. Using high-throughput reduced representation bisulphite sequencing and single-molecule-based sequencing, we generated DNA methylation maps covering most CpG islands, and a representative sampling of conserved non-coding elements, transposons and other genomic features, for mouse embryonic stem cells, embryonic-stem-cell-derived and primary neural cells, and eight other primary tissues. Several key findings emerge from the data. First, DNA methylation patterns are better correlated with histone methylation patterns than with the underlying genome sequence context. Second, methylation of CpGs are dynamic epigenetic marks that undergo extensive changes during cellular differentiation, particularly in regulatory regions outside of core promoters. Third, analysis of embryonic-stem-cell-derived and primary cells reveals that 'weak' CpG islands associated with a specific set of developmentally regulated genes undergo aberrant hypermethylation during extended proliferation in vitro, in a pattern reminiscent of that reported in some primary tumours. More generally, the results establish reduced representation bisulphite sequencing as a powerful technology for epigenetic profiling of cell populations relevant to developmental biology, cancer and regenerative medicine.},

abstract = {We express the Crow-Kimura and Eigen models of quasispecies theory in a functional integral representation. We formulate the spin coherent state functional integrals using the Schwinger Boson method. In this formulation, we are able to deduce the long-time behavior of these models for arbitrary replication and degradation functions. We discuss the phase transitions that occur in these models as a function of mutation rate. We derive for these models the leading order corrections to the infinite genome length limit.},

title = {Universality of weak selection},
abstract = { Weak selection, which means a phenotype is slightly advantageous over another, is an important limiting case in evolutionary biology. Recently it has been introduced into evolutionary game theory. In evolutionary game dynamics, the probability to be imitated or to reproduce depends on the performance in a game. The influence of the game on the stochastic dynamics in finite populations is governed by the intensity of selection. In many models of both unstructured and structured populations, a key assumption allowing analytical calculations is weak selection, which means that all individuals perform approximately equally well. In the weak selection limit many different microscopic evolutionary models have the same or similar properties. How universal is weak selection for those microscopic evolutionary processes? We answer this question by investigating the fixation probability and the average fixation time not only up to linear, but also up to higher orders in selection intensity. We find universal higher order expansions, which allow a rescaling of the selection intensity. With this, we can identify specific models which violate (linear) weak selection results, such as the one-third rule of coordination games in finite but large populations. },

title = {Hitchhiking effects of recurrent beneficial amino acid substitutions in the {Drosophila} melanogaster genome},
abstract = {Several recent studies have estimated that a large fraction of amino acid divergence between species of Drosophila was fixed by positive selection, using statistical approaches based on the McDonald-Kreitman test. However, little is known about associated selection coefficients of beneficial amino acid mutations. Recurrent selective sweeps associated with adaptive substitutions should leave a characteristic signature in genome variability data that contains information about the frequency and strength of selection. Here, I document a significant negative correlation between the level and the frequency of synonymous site polymorphism and the rate of protein evolution in highly recombining regions of the X chromosome of D. melanogaster. This pattern is predicted by recurrent adaptive protein evolution and suggests that adaptation is an important determinant of patterns of neutral variation genome-wide. Using a maximum likelihood approach, I estimate the product of the rate and strength of selection under a recurrent genetic hitchhiking model, lambda2N(e)s approximately 3 x 10(-8). Using an approach based on the McDonald-Kreitman test, I estimate that approximately 50% of divergent amino acids were driven to fixation by positive selection, implying that beneficial amino acid substitutions are of weak effect on average, on the order of 10(-5) (i.e., 2N(e)s approximately 40). Two implications of these results are that most adaptive substitutions will be difficult to detect in genome scans of selection and that population size (and genetic drift) may be an important determinant of the evolutionary dynamics of protein adaptation.},

title = {Incremental steps toward incompatibility revealed by Arabidopsis epistatic interactions modulating salicylic acid pathway activation},
abstract = {Plant growth is influenced by genetic factors and environmental cues. Genotype-by-environment interactions are governed by complex genetic epistatic networks that are subject to natural selection. Here we describe a novel epistatic interaction modulating growth in response to temperature common to 2 Arabidopsis recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations (Ler x Kas-2 and Ler x Kond). At 14 degrees C, lines with specific allele combinations at interacting loci (incompatible interactions) have severe growth defects. These lines exhibit deregulated cell death programs and enhanced disease resistance. At 20 degrees C, growth defects are suppressed, but a positive trait of enhanced resistance is retained. Mapping of 1 interacting QTL to a cluster of RPP1-like TIR-NB-LRR genes on chromosome 3 is consistent with our finding that environmentally conditioned epistasis depends on activation of the salicylic acid (SA) stress signaling pathway. The nature of the epistatic interaction conforms to the Dobzhansky-Muller model of genetic incompatibility with incomplete penetrance for reproductive isolation. Variation in fitness of different incompatible lines reveals the presence of additional modifiers in the genetic background. We propose that certain interacting loci lead to an optimal balance between growth and resistance to pathogens by modulating SA signaling under specific environments. This could allow the accumulation of additional incompatibilities before reaching complete reproductive isolation.},

abstract = {Sometimes mutations in two genes produce a phenotype that is surprising in light of each mutation's individual effects. This phenomenon, which defines genetic interaction, can reveal functional relationships between genes and pathways. For example, double mutants with surprisingly slow growth define synergistic interactions that can identify compensatory pathways or protein complexes. Recent studies have used four mathematically distinct definitions of genetic interaction (here termed Product, Additive, Log, and Min). Whether this choice holds practical consequences has not been clear, because the definitions yield identical results under some conditions. Here, we show that the choice among alternative definitions can have profound consequences. Although 52% of known synergistic genetic interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were inferred according to the Min definition, we find that both Product and Log definitions (shown here to be practically equivalent) are better than Min for identifying functional relationships. Additionally, we show that the Additive and Log definitions, each commonly used in population genetics, lead to differing conclusions related to the selective advantages of sexual reproduction.},

abstract = {A previous polymorphism survey of the type 2 diabetes gene CAPN10 identified a segment showing an excess of polymorphism levels in all population samples, coinciding with localized breakdown of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in a sample of Hausa from Cameroon, but not in non-African samples. This raised the possibility that a recombination hotspot is present in all populations and we had insufficient power to detect it in the non-African data. To test this possibility, we estimated the crossover rate by sperm typing in five non-African men; these estimates were consistent with the LD decay in the non-African, but not in the Hausa data. Moreover, resequencing the orthologous region in a sample of Western chimpanzees did not show either an excess of polymorphism level or rapid LD decay, suggesting that the processes underlying the patterns observed in humans operated only on the human lineage. These results suggest that a hotspot of recombination has recently arisen in humans and has reached higher frequency in the Hausa than in non-Africans, or that there is no elevation in crossover rate in any human population, and the observed variation results from long-standing balancing selection.},

title = {The {Hill-Robertson effect}: evolutionary consequences of weak selection and linkage in finite populations},
abstract = {The 'Hill-Robertson (HR) effect' describes that linkage between sites under selection will reduce the overall effectiveness of selection in finite populations. Here we discuss the major concepts associated with the HR effect and present results of computer simulations focusing on the linkage effects generated by multiple sites under weak selection. Most models of linkage and selection forecast differences in effectiveness of selection between chromosomes or chromosomal regions involving a number of genes. The abundance and physical clustering of weakly selected mutations across genomes, however, justify the investigation of HR effects at a very local level and we pay particular attention to linkage effects among selected sites of the same gene. Overall, HR effects caused by weakly selected mutations predict differences in effectiveness of selection between genes that differ in exon-intron structures and across genes. Under this scenario, introns might play an advantageous role reducing intragenic HR effects. Finally, we summarize observations that are consistent with local HR effects in Drosophila, discuss potential consequences on population genetic studies and suggest future lines of research.},

Recently, there has been increasing realization that the role of chromosomal rearrangements in speciation might be primarily a result of their influence on recombination. I argue that ideas about the role of recombination in speciation should be considered in the context of the variability of recombination rates and patterns more generally and that genic as well as chromosomal causes of restricted recombination should be considered. I review patterns of variation in recombination rates and theoretical progress in understanding the conditions that favour increased or decreased rates. Although progress has been made in understanding conditions that alter overall rates of recombination, widespread variation in patterns of recombination remains largely unexplained. I consider three models for the role of locally restricted recombination in speciation and the evidence currently supporting them.},

title = {Disentangling direct from indirect co-evolution of residues in protein alignments},
abstract = {Predicting protein structure from primary sequence is one of the ultimate challenges in computational biology. Given the large amount of available sequence data, the analysis of co-evolution, i.e., statistical dependency, between columns in multiple alignments of protein domain sequences remains one of the most promising avenues for predicting residues that are contacting in the structure. A key impediment to this approach is that strong statistical dependencies are also observed for many residue pairs that are distal in the structure. Using a comprehensive analysis of protein domains with available three-dimensional structures we show that co-evolving contacts very commonly form chains that percolate through the protein structure, inducing indirect statistical dependencies between many distal pairs of residues. We characterize the distributions of length and spatial distance traveled by these co-evolving contact chains and show that they explain a large fraction of observed statistical dependencies between structurally distal pairs. We adapt a recently developed Bayesian network model into a rigorous procedure for disentangling direct from indirect statistical dependencies, and we demonstrate that this method not only successfully accomplishes this task, but also allows contacts with weak statistical dependency to be detected. To illustrate how additional information can be incorporated into our method, we incorporate a phylogenetic correction, and we develop an informative prior that takes into account that the probability for a pair of residues to contact depends strongly on their primary-sequence distance and the amount of conservation that the corresponding columns in the multiple alignment exhibit. We show that our model including these extensions dramatically improves the accuracy of contact prediction from multiple sequence alignments.},

abstract = {Although human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) recombinants have been found with high frequency, little is known about the forces that select for these viruses or their importance to pathogenesis. Here we document the emergence and dynamics of 11 distinct HIV-1 recombinants in a man who was infected with two subtype B HIV-1 strains and progressed rapidly to AIDS without developing substantial cellular or humoral immune responses. Although numerous frequency oscillations were observed, a single recombinant lineage eventually came to dominate the population. Numerical simulations indicate that the successive recombinant forms displaced each other too rapidly to be explained by any simple model of random genetic drift or sampling variation. All of the recombinants, including several resulting from independent recombination events, possessed the same sequence motif in the V3 loop, suggesting intense selection on this segment of the viral envelope protein. The outgrowth of the predominant V3 loop recombinants was not, however, associated with changes in coreceptor utilization. The final variant was instead notable for having lost 3 of 14 potential glycosylation sites. We also observed high ratios of synonymous-to-nonsynonymous nucleotide changes-suggestive of purifying selection-in all viral populations, with particularly high ratios in newly arising recombinants. Our study, therefore, illustrates the unusual and important patterns of viral adaptation that can occur in a patient with weak immune responses. Although it is hard to tease apart cause and effect in a single patient, the correlation with disease progression in this patient suggests that recombination between divergent viruses, with its ability to create chimeras with increased fitness, can accelerate progression to AIDS.},

title = {Why high-error-rate random mutagenesis libraries are enriched in functional and improved proteins},
abstract = {The fraction of proteins that retain wild-type function after mutation has long been observed to decline exponentially as the average number of mutations per gene increases. Recently, several groups have used error-prone polymerase chain reactions (PCR) to generate libraries with 15 to 30 mutations per gene, on average, and have reported that orders of magnitude more proteins retain function than would be expected from the low-mutation-rate trend. Proteins with improved or novel function were isolated disproportionately from these high-error-rate libraries, leading to claims that high mutation rates unlock regions of sequence space that are enriched in positively coupled mutations. Here, we show experimentally that error-prone PCR produces a broader non-Poisson distribution of mutations consistent with a detailed model of PCR. As error rates increase, this distribution leads directly to the observed excesses in functional clones. We then show that while very low mutation rates result in many functional sequences, only a small number are unique. By contrast, very high mutation rates produce mostly unique sequences, but few retain function. Thus an optimal mutation rate exists that balances uniqueness and retention of function. Overall, high-error-rate mutagenesis libraries are enriched in improved sequences because they contain more unique, functional clones. Our findings demonstrate how optimal error-prone PCR mutation rates may be calculated, and indicate that "optimal" rates depend on both the protein and the mutagenesis protocol.},

title = {Adaptive evolution of transcription factor binding sites},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The regulation of a gene depends on the binding of transcription factors to specific sites located in the regulatory region of the gene. The generation of these binding sites and of cooperativity between them are essential building blocks in the evolution of complex regulatory networks. We study a theoretical model for the sequence evolution of binding sites by point mutations. The approach is based on biophysical models for the binding of transcription factors to DNA. Hence we derive empirically grounded fitness landscapes, which enter a population genetics model including mutations, genetic drift, and selection. RESULTS: We show that the selection for factor binding generically leads to specific correlations between nucleotide frequencies at different positions of a binding site. We demonstrate the possibility of rapid adaptive evolution generating a new binding site for a given transcription factor by point mutations. The evolutionary time required is estimated in terms of the neutral (background) mutation rate, the selection coefficient, and the effective population size. CONCLUSIONS: The efficiency of binding site formation is seen to depend on two joint conditions: the binding site motif must be short enough and the promoter region must be long enough. These constraints on promoter architecture are indeed seen in eukaryotic systems. Furthermore, we analyse the adaptive evolution of genetic switches and of signal integration through binding cooperativity between different sites. Experimental tests of this picture involving the statistics of polymorphisms and phylogenies of sites are discussed.},

title = {Distinguishing functional amino acid covariation from background linkage disequilibrium in HIV protease and reverse transcriptase},
abstract = {Correlated amino acid mutation analysis has been widely used to infer functional interactions between different sites in a protein. However, this analysis can be confounded by important phylogenetic effects broadly classifiable as background linkage disequilibrium (BLD). We have systematically separated the covariation induced by selective interactions between amino acids from background LD, using synonymous (S) vs. amino acid (A) mutations. Covariation between two amino acid mutations, (A,A), can be affected by selective interactions between amino acids, whereas covariation within (A,S) pairs or (S,S) pairs cannot. Our analysis of the pol gene--including the protease and the reverse transcriptase genes--in HIV reveals that (A,A) covariation levels are enormously higher than for either (A,S) or (S,S), and thus cannot be attributed to phylogenetic effects. The magnitude of these effects suggests that a large portion of (A,A) covariation in the HIV pol gene results from selective interactions. Inspection of the most prominent (A,A) interactions in the HIV pol gene showed that they are known sites of independently identified drug resistance mutations, and physically cluster around the drug binding site. Moreover, the specific set of (A,A) interaction pairs was reproducible in different drug treatment studies, and vanished in untreated HIV samples. The (S,S) covariation curves measured a low but detectable level of background LD in HIV.},

abstract = {The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans reproduces primarily by self-fertilization of hermaphrodites, yet males are present at low frequencies in natural populations (androdioecy). The ancestral state of C. elegans was probably gonochorism (separate males and females), as in its relative C. remanei. Males may be maintained in C. elegans because outcrossed individuals escape inbreeding depression. The level of inbreeding depression is, however, expected to be low in such a highly selfing species, compared with an outcrosser like C. remanei. To investigate these issues, we measured life-history traits in the progeny of inbred versus outcrossed C. elegans and C. remanei individuals derived from recently isolated natural populations. In addition, we maintained inbred lines of C. remanei through 13 generations of full-sibling mating. Highly inbred C. remanei showed dramatic reductions in brood size and relative fitness compared to outcrossed individuals, with evidence of both direct genetic and maternal-effect inbreeding depression. This decline in fitness accumulated over time, causing extinction of nearly 90% of inbred lines, with no evidence of purging of deleterious mutations from the remaining lines. In contrast, pure strains of C. elegans performed better than crosses between strains, indicating outbreeding depression. The results are discussed in relation to the evolution of androdioecy and the effect of mating system on the level of inbreeding depression.},

title = {Identification of direct residue contacts in protein-protein interaction by message passing},
abstract = {Understanding the molecular determinants of specificity in protein-protein interaction is an outstanding challenge of postgenome biology. The availability of large protein databases generated from sequences of hundreds of bacterial genomes enables various statistical approaches to this problem. In this context covariance-based methods have been used to identify correlation between amino acid positions in interacting proteins. However, these methods have an important shortcoming, in that they cannot distinguish between directly and indirectly correlated residues. We developed a method that combines covariance analysis with global inference analysis, adopted from use in statistical physics. Applied to a set of >2,500 representatives of the bacterial two-component signal transduction system, the combination of covariance with global inference successfully and robustly identified residue pairs that are proximal in space without resorting to ad hoc tuning parameters, both for heterointeractions between sensor kinase (SK) and response regulator (RR) proteins and for homointeractions between RR proteins. The spectacular success of this approach illustrates the effectiveness of the global inference approach in identifying direct interaction based on sequence information alone. We expect this method to be applicable soon to interaction surfaces between proteins present in only 1 copy per genome as the number of sequenced genomes continues to expand. Use of this method could significantly increase the potential targets for therapeutic intervention, shed light on the mechanism of protein-protein interaction, and establish the foundation for the accurate prediction of interacting protein partners.},

title = {The case for selection at CCR5-Delta32},
abstract = {The C-C chemokine receptor 5, 32 base-pair deletion (CCR5-Delta32) allele confers strong resistance to infection by the AIDS virus HIV. Previous studies have suggested that CCR5-Delta32 arose within the past 1,000 y and rose to its present high frequency (5%-14%) in Europe as a result of strong positive selection, perhaps by such selective agents as the bubonic plague or smallpox during the Middle Ages. This hypothesis was based on several lines of evidence, including the absence of the allele outside of Europe and long-range linkage disequilibrium at the locus. We reevaluated this evidence with the benefit of much denser genetic maps and extensive control data. We find that the pattern of genetic variation at CCR5-Delta32 does not stand out as exceptional relative to other loci across the genome. Moreover using newer genetic maps, we estimated that the CCR5-Delta32 allele is likely to have arisen more than 5,000 y ago. While such results can not rule out the possibility that some selection may have occurred at C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), they imply that the pattern of genetic variation seen at CCR5-Delta32 is consistent with neutral evolution. More broadly, the results have general implications for the design of future studies to detect the signs of positive selection in the human genome.},

title = {Confounding from cryptic relatedness in case-control association studies},
abstract = {Case-control association studies are widely used in the search for genetic variants that contribute to human diseases. It has long been known that such studies may suffer from high rates of false positives if there is unrecognized population structure. It is perhaps less widely appreciated that so-called "cryptic relatedness" (i.e., kinship among the cases or controls that is not known to the investigator) might also potentially inflate the false positive rate. Until now there has been little work to assess how serious this problem is likely to be in practice. In this paper, we develop a formal model of cryptic relatedness, and study its impact on association studies. We provide simple expressions that predict the extent of confounding due to cryptic relatedness. Surprisingly, these expressions are functions of directly observable parameters. Our analytical results show that, for well-designed studies in outbred populations, the degree of confounding due to cryptic relatedness will usually be negligible. However, in contrast, studies where there is a sampling bias toward collecting relatives may indeed suffer from excessive rates of false positives. Furthermore, cryptic relatedness may be a serious concern in founder populations that have grown rapidly and recently from a small size. As an example, we analyze the impact of excess relatedness among cases for six phenotypes measured in the Hutterite population.},

Here, I investigate the statistical properties of a measure of interlocus genetic associations under the assumption that mutations are selectively neutral and sites are completely linked. This measure, denoted ZnS, is based on the squared correlation of allelic identity at pairs of polymorphic sites. Upper bounds for ZnS are determined by simulations. Various deviations from the neutral model, including several different forms of natural selection, will inflate the value of ZnS relative to its neutral theory expectations. Larger than expected values of ZnS are observed in genetic samples from the yellow-ac-scute and Adh regions of Drosophila melanogaster.},

abstract = {Single-molecule manipulation techniques reveal that the mechanical resistance of a protein depends on the direction of the applied force. Using a lattice model of polymers, we show that changing the pulling direction leads to different phase diagrams. The simple model proposed here indicates that in one case the system undergoes a transition akin to the unzipping of a beta sheet, while in the other case the transition is of a shearing (slippage) nature. Our results are qualitatively similar to experimental results. This demonstrates the importance of varying the pulling direction since this may yield enhanced insights into the molecular interactions responsible for the stability of biomolecules.},

title = {Comparing evolvability and variability of quantitative traits},
abstract = {There are two distinct reasons for making comparisons of genetic variation for quantitative characters. The first is to compare evolvabilities, or ability to respond to selection, and the second is to make inferences about the forces that maintain genetic variability. Measures of variation that are standardized by the trait mean, such as the additive genetic coefficient of variation, are appropriate for both purposes. Variation has usually been compared as narrow sense heritabilities, but this is almost always an inappropriate comparative measure of evolvability and variability. Coefficients of variation were calculated from 842 estimates of trait means, variances and heritabilities in the literature. Traits closely related to fitness have higher additive genetic and nongenetic variability by the coefficient of variation criterion than characters under weak selection. This is the reverse of the accepted conclusion based on comparisons of heritability. The low heritability of fitness components is best explained by their high residual variation. The high additive genetic and residual variability of fitness traits might be explained by the great number of genetic and environmental events they are affected by, or by a lack of stabilizing selection to reduce their phenotypic variance. Over one-third of the quantitative genetics papers reviewed did not report trait means or variances. Researchers should always report these statistics, so that measures of variation appropriate to a variety of situations may be calculated.},

Here, we showed by live-cell imaging of intact cell populations that pulses originate from a discrete location despite constant exchange of cells to and from the region. In a perfusion chamber, both isolated single cells and cell populations switched from quiescence to rhythmic activity depending on the concentration of extracellular cAMP. A quantitative analysis showed that stochastic pulsing of individual cells below the threshold concentration of extracellular cAMP plays a critical role in the onset of collective behavior.},

title = {Genetics and the fitness of hybrids},
abstract = {Over the years, the evolutionary importance of natural hybridization has been a contentious issue. At one extreme is the relatively common view of hybridization as an evolutionarily unimportant process. A less common perspective, but one that has gained support over the past decade, is that of hybridization as a relatively widespread and potentially creative evolutionary process. Indeed, studies documenting the production of hybrid genotypes exhibiting a wide range of fitnesses have become increasingly common. In this review, we examine the genetic basis of such variation in hybrid fitness. In particular, we assess the genetic architecture of hybrid inferiority (both sterility and inviability). We then extend our discussion to the genetic basis of increased fitness in certain hybrid genotypes. The available evidence argues that hybrid inferiority is the result of widespread negative epistasis in a hybrid genetic background. In contrast, increased hybrid fitness can be most readily explained through the segregation of additive genetic factors, with epistasis playing a more limited role.},

abstract = {A method for spectral analysis of F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) signals is presented, taking into consideration both the contributions of unpaired donor and acceptor fluorophores and the influence of incomplete labeling of the interacting partners. It is shown that spectral analysis of intermolecular FRET cannot yield accurate values of the F{\"o}rster energy transfer efficiency E, unless one of the interactors is in large excess and perfectly labeled. Instead, analysis of donor quenching yields a product of the form Ef(d)p(a), where f(d) is the fraction of donor-type molecules participating in donor-acceptor complexes and p(a) is the labeling probability of the acceptor. Similarly, analysis of sensitized emission yields a product involving Ef(a). The analysis of intramolecular FRET (e.g., of tandem constructs) yields the product Ep(a). We use our method to determine these values for a tandem construct of cyan fluorescent protein and yellow fluorescent protein and compare them with those obtained by standard acceptor photobleaching and fluorescence lifetime measurements. We call the method lux-FRET, since it relies on linear unmixing of spectral components.},

abstract = {This paper examines patterns of heritability and genetic covariance between traits in the genus Drosophila. Traits are divided into the categories, morphology, behaviour, physiology and life history. Early theoretical analyses suggested that life history traits should have heritabilities that are lower than those in other categories. Variable pleiotrophy, environmental variation, mutation and niche variation may, however, maintain high heritabilities. In Drosophila the heritabilities of life history traits are lower than morphological or physiological traits but may exceed 20 per cent. The pattern of variation in the heritability of behavioural traits is similar to that of life history traits. Genetic covariance between morphological traits and between morphological and life history traits are all positive but those between life history traits have variable sign. Negative covariance between traits supports the variable pleiotropy hypothesis but other factors such as environmental heterogeneity, or mutation cannot be excluded.},

title = {Nramp transfection transfers Ity/Lsh/Bcg-related pleiotropic effects on macrophage activation: influence on oxidative burst and nitric oxide pathways},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Ity/Lsh/Bcg gene on mouse chromosome 1 regulates priming/activation of macrophages for antimicrobial and tumouricidal activity. A candidate gene expressed in macrophages has been identified by positional cloning and full-length sequence analysis, and encodes the Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (Nramp). In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that the Nramp gene corresponds to Ity/Lsh/Bcg. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro transfection was used to introduce the resistant allele into the macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 derived from the recessive susceptible BALB/c mouse strain. Expression of the transgene was monitored on the background of the endogenous susceptible allele by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization. RESULTS: Expression of the transgene correlated with three Lshr-associated lipopolysaccharide/interferon-gamma-regulated macrophage activation phenotypes: respiratory burst, nitrite release, and uptake of L-arginine. Endogenous and stimulated L-arginine fluxes were inhibitable with the radical scavengers nordihydroguaiaretic acid and butylated hydroxyanisole. The mitochondrial electron transport inhibitors, rotenone and thenoyltrifluoroacetone, inhibited respiratory burst, and rotenone suppressed L-arginine flux, implying that mitochondrial-derived oxygen radicals are important mediators in Nramp-regulated signal transduction pathways. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide the first direct evidence that Nramp is the product of the Ity/Lsh/Bcg gene, and are consistent with the hypothesis that the many pleiotropic effects of this gene on macrophage activation may all derive from the requirement for mitochondrial generation of oxygen radicals for intracellular signaling.},

title = {Multidimensional epistasis and the disadvantage of sex},
abstract = {Sex is thought to facilitate accumulation of initially rare beneficial mutations by allowing simultaneous allele replacements at many loci. However, this advantage of sex depends on a restrictive assumption that the fitness of a genotype is determined by fitness potential, a single intermediate variable to which all loci contribute additively, so that new alleles can accumulate in any order. Individual-based simulations of sexual and asexual populations reveal that under generic selection, sex often retards adaptive evolution. When new alleles are beneficial only if they accumulate in a prescribed order, a sexual population may evolve two or more times slower than an asexual population because only asexual reproduction allows some overlap of successive allele replacements. Many other fitness surfaces lead to an even greater disadvantage of sex. Thus, either sex exists in spite of its impact on the rate of adaptive allele replacements, or natural fitness surfaces have rather specific properties, at least at the scale of intrapopulation genetic variability.},

title = {Bayesian inference of population size history from multiple loci},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Effective population size (Ne) is related to genetic variability and is a basic parameter in many models of population genetics. A number of methods for inferring current and past population sizes from genetic data have been developed since JFC Kingman introduced the n-coalescent in 1982. Here we present the Extended Bayesian Skyline Plot, a non-parametric Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that extends a previous coalescent-based method in several ways, including the ability to analyze multiple loci. RESULTS: Through extensive simulations we show the accuracy and limitations of inferring population size as a function of the amount of data, including recovering information about evolutionary bottlenecks. We also analyzed two real data sets to demonstrate the behavior of the new method; a single gene Hepatitis C virus data set sampled from Egypt and a 10 locus Drosophila ananassae data set representing 16 different populations. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate the essential role of multiple loci in recovering population size dynamics. Multi-locus data from a small number of individuals can precisely recover past bottlenecks in population size which can not be characterized by analysis of a single locus. We also demonstrate that sequence data quality is important because even moderate levels of sequencing errors result in a considerable decrease in estimation accuracy for realistic levels of population genetic variability.},

title = {Stochastic tunnels in evolutionary dynamics},
abstract = {We study a situation that arises in the somatic evolution of cancer. Consider a finite population of replicating cells and a sequence of mutations: type 0 can mutate to type 1, which can mutate to type 2. There is no back mutation. We start with a homogeneous population of type 0. Mutants of type 1 emerge and either become extinct or reach fixation. In both cases, they can generate type 2, which also can become extinct or reach fixation. If mutation rates are small compared to the inverse of the population size, then the stochastic dynamics can be described by transitions between homogeneous populations. A "stochastic tunnel" arises, when the population moves from all 0 to all 2 without ever being all 1. We calculate the exact rate of stochastic tunneling for the case when type 1 is as fit as type 0 or less fit. Type 2 has the highest fitness. We discuss implications for the elimination of tumor suppressor genes and the activation of genetic instability. Although our theory is developed for cancer genetics, stochastic tunnels are general phenomena that could arise in many circumstances.},

Identifying these residues from the amino acid sequences alone would be useful. Classically, strictly conserved residues are predicted to be functional but often conservation patterns are more complicated. Here, we present a novel method that exploits such patterns for the prediction of functional residues. The method uses a simple but powerful representation of entire proteins, as well as sequence residues as vectors in a generalised 'sequence space'. Projection of these vectors onto a lower-dimensional space reveals groups of residues specific for particular subfamilies that are predicted to be directly involved in protein function. Based on the method we present testable predictions for sets of functional residues in SH2 domains and in the conserved box of cyclins.},

abstract = {The order of appearance in the reverse transcriptase gene of four mutations implicated in the development of resistance to zidovudine was investigated by selective polymerase chain reaction. Serial human immunodeficiency virus isolates were studied from 18 initially asymptomatic individuals who had been treated with zidovudine for 2 years. Most subjects had similar patterns. The first mutation occurred transiently at codon 70; its disappearance was paralleled by the appearance of a mutation at codon 215. Subsequently, in some individuals, the mutation at codon 70 reappeared. During the 2 years of treatment, no mutations developed at codon 219 and only one at codon 67, suggesting that most individuals developed only partly resistant virus. This was confirmed by plaque-reduction assay. Six subjects progressed to AIDS within the 2-year study period, confirming that the development of highly resistant isolates is not required for progression in treated individuals. No clear temporal relationship was found between the development of partial resistance and progression.},

title = {Conservation and evolution of cis-regulatory systems in ascomycete fungi},
abstract = {Relatively little is known about the mechanisms through which gene expression regulation evolves. To investigate this, we systematically explored the conservation of regulatory networks in fungi by examining the cis-regulatory elements that govern the expression of coregulated genes. We first identified groups of coregulated Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes enriched for genes with known upstream or downstream cis-regulatory sequences. Reasoning that many of these gene groups are coregulated in related species as well, we performed similar analyses on orthologs of coregulated S. cerevisiae genes in 13 other ascomycete species. We find that many species-specific gene groups are enriched for the same flanking regulatory sequences as those found in the orthologous gene groups fromS. cerevisiae, indicating that those regulatory systems have been conserved in multiple ascomycete species. In addition to these clear cases of regulatory conservation, we find examples of cis-element evolution that suggest multiple modes of regulatory diversification, including alterations in transcription factor-binding specificity, incorporation of new gene targets into an existing regulatory system, and cooption of regulatory systems to control a different set of genes. We investigated one example in greater detail by measuring the in vitro activity of the S. cerevisiae transcription factor Rpn4p and its orthologs from Candida albicans and Neurospora crassa. Our results suggest that the DNA binding specificity of these proteins has coevolved with the sequences found upstream of the Rpn4p target genes and suggest that Rpn4p has a different function in N. crassa.},

Everything else being equal, asexual populations are expected to have twice the number of offspring produced by similar sexual populations. Yet, asexual species are uncommon among higher eukaryotes. In models assuming small populations, high mutation rates, or frequent environmental changes, sexual reproduction seems to have at least a two-fold advantage over asexuality. But the advantage of sex for large populations, low mutation rates, and rare or mild environmental changes remains a conundrum. Here we show that without recombination, rare advantageous mutations can result in increased accumulation of deleterious mutations ('evolutionary traction'), which explains the long-term advantage of sex under a wide parameter range.},

Analytical solutions for the time-dependent shapes of such moving polymers are obtained within an analysis applicable to small-amplitude deformations. In the case of oscillatory driving, particular attention is paid to a characteristic length determined by the frequency of oscillation, the polymer persistence length, and the viscous drag coefficient. Experiments on actin filaments manipulated with optical traps confirm the scaling law predicted by the analysis and provide a new technique for measuring the elastic bending modulus. Exploiting this model, we also present a reanalysis of several published experiments on microtubules.},

title = {On reconciling single and recurrent hitchhiking models},
abstract = {A major focus of modern population genetics involves using polymorphism data in order to identify regions impacted by recent positive selection (so-called genomic scans). Recently, methodology has been proposed not to identify individual loci, but rather to quantify genomic recurrent hitchhiking (RHH) parameters using this same type of polymorphism data. I here examine to what extent genomic scans for adaptively important loci may be informed by recently estimated RHH parameters (and vice versa). I find that published results are largely incompatible with one another, with approximately an order of magnitude more sweeps being empirically identified than would be predicted under RHH estimates. Results demonstrate that making this connection between SHH and RHH models is crucial for a more complete and accurate characterization of adaptive evolution.},

abstract = {We study the evolution of transcription factor-binding sites in prokaryotes, using an empirically grounded model with point mutations and genetic drift. Selection acts on the site sequence via its binding affinity to the corresponding transcription factor. Calibrating the model with populations of functional binding sites, we verify this form of selection and show that typical sites are under substantial selection pressure for functionality: for cAMP response protein sites in Escherichia coli, the product of fitness difference and effective population size takes values 2NDeltaF of order 10. We apply this model to cross-species comparisons of binding sites in bacteria and obtain a prediction method for binding sites that uses evolutionary information in a quantitative way. At the same time, this method predicts the functional histories of orthologous sites in a phylogeny, evaluating the likelihood for conservation or loss or gain of function during evolution. We have performed, as an example, a cross-species analysis of E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Detailed lists of predicted sites and their functional phylogenies are available.},

Massive parallel pyrosequencing was used with the shotgun approach. Intrahost genetic variability along the whole genome was calculated and coreceptor usage of viral quasispecies was predicted. A consensus sequence was established to perform subtype assignment, phylogenetic analysis, and recombination tests. The sequence clustered with two recently described BF unique recombinant forms from Brazil, consistent with the recombination pattern, yielding breakpoints located at the same positions, with the exception of the second env breakpoint. The actual prevalence of recombinant forms is probably underestimated if partial genomic regions are considered. Here the first full length BF recombinant from Italy is described, together with an evaluation of quasispecies heterogeneity.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: B-cell epitopes are the sites of molecules that are recognized by antibodies of the immune system. Knowledge of B-cell epitopes may be used in the design of vaccines and diagnostics tests. It is therefore of interest to develop improved methods for predicting B-cell epitopes. In this paper, we describe an improved method for predicting linear B-cell epitopes. RESULTS: In order to do this, three data sets of linear B-cell epitope annotated proteins were constructed. A data set was collected from the literature, another data set was extracted from the AntiJen database and a data sets of epitopes in the proteins of HIV was collected from the Los Alamos HIV database. An unbiased validation of the methods was made by testing on data sets on which they were neither trained nor optimized on. We have measured the performance in a non-parametric way by constructing ROC-curves. CONCLUSION: The best single method for predicting linear B-cell epitopes is the hidden Markov model. Combining the hidden Markov model with one of the best propensity scale methods, we obtained the BepiPred method. When tested on the validation data set this method performs significantly better than any of the other methods tested. The server and data sets are publicly available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/BepiPred.},

Comparing numerical simulations of the rate equations in the non-recombining and recombining cases show that recombination has a strong effect on the error threshold and, for a wide range of mutation rates, gives rise to two stable fixed points in the dynamics. This bi-stability results in the existence of two error thresholds. However, we prove that, for low mutation rates the bi-stability breaks down and the unique equilibrium distribution is concentrated around the sequence with highest fitness.},

title = {The determinants of gene order conservation in yeasts},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Why do some groups of physically linked genes stay linked over long evolutionary periods? Although several factors are associated with the formation of gene clusters in eukaryotic genomes, the particular contribution of each feature to clustering maintenance remains unclear. RESULTS: We quantify the strength of the proposed factors in a yeast lineage. First we identify the magnitude of each variable to determine linkage conservation by using several comparator species at different distances to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For adjacent gene pairs, in line with null simulations, intergenic distance acts as the strongest covariate. Which of the other covariates appear important depends on the comparator, although high co-expression is related to synteny conservation commonly, especially in the more distant comparisons, these being expected to reveal strong but relatively rare selection. We also analyze those pairs that are immediate neighbors through all the lineages considered. Current intergene distance is again the best predictor, followed by the local density of essential genes and co-regulation, with co-expression and recombination rate being the weakest predictors. The genome duplication seen in yeast leaves some mark on linkage conservation, as adjacent pairs resolved as single copy in all post-whole genome duplication species are more often found as adjacent in pre-duplication species. CONCLUSION: Current intergene distance is consistently the strongest predictor of synteny conservation as expected under a simple null model. Other variables are of lesser importance and their relevance depends both on the species comparison in question and the fate of the duplicates following genome duplication.},

title = {THE EVOLUTION OF STRONG REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION},
abstract = {Felsenstein distinguished two ways by which selection can directly strengthen isolation. First, a modifier that strengthens prezygotic isolation can be favored everywhere. This fits with the traditional view of reinforcement as an adaptation to reduce deleterious hybridization by strengthening assortative mating. Second, selection can favor association between different incompatibilities, despite recombination. We generalize this "two allele" model to follow associations among any number of incompatibilities, which may include both assortment and hybrid inviability. Our key argument is that this process, of coupling between incompatibilities, may be quite different from the usual view of reinforcement: strong isolation can evolve through the coupling of any kind of incompatibility, whether prezygotic or postzygotic. Single locus incompatibilities become coupled because associations between them increase the variance in compatibility, which in turn increases mean fitness if there is positive epistasis. Multiple incompatibilities, each maintained by epistasis, can become coupled in the same way. In contrast, a single-locus incompatibility can become coupled with loci that reduce the viability of haploid hybrids because this reduces harmful recombination. We obtain simple approximations for the limits of tight linkage, and strong assortment, and show how assortment alleles can invade through associations with other components of reproductive isolation.},

abstract = {If multiple linked polymorphisms are under natural selection, then conflicts arise and the efficiency of natural selection is hindered relative to the case of no linkage. This simple interaction between linkage and natural selection creates an opportunity for mutations that raise the level of recombination to increase in frequency and have an enhanced chance of fixation. This important finding by S. Otto and N. Barton means that mutations that raise the recombination rate, but are otherwise neutral, will be selectively favored under fairly general circumstances of multilocus selection and linkage. The effect described by Otto and Barton, which was limited to neutral modifiers, can also be extended to include all modifiers of recombination, both beneficial and deleterious. Computer simulations show that beneficial mutations that also increase recombination have an increased chance of fixation. Similarly, deleterious mutations that also decrease recombination have an increased chance of fixation. The results suggest that a simple model of recombination modifiers, including both neutral and pleiotropic modifiers, is a necessary explanation for the evolutionary origin of recombination.},

title = {The statistical mechanics of a polygenic characterunder stabilizing  selection, mutation and drift},
abstract = { By exploiting an analogy between population genetics and statistical mechanics, we study the evolution of a polygenic trait under stabilizing selection, mutation, and genetic drift. This requires us to track only four macroscopic variables, instead of the distribution of all the allele frequencies that influence the trait. These macroscopic variables are the expectations of: the trait mean and its square, the genetic variance, and of a measure of heterozygosity, and are derived from a generating function that is in turn derived by maximizing an entropy measure. These four macroscopics are enough to accurately describe the dynamics of the trait mean and of its genetic variance (and in principle of any other quantity). Unlike previous approaches that were based on an infinite series of moments or cumulants, which had to be truncated arbitrarily, our calculations provide a well-defined approximation procedure. We apply the framework to abrupt and gradual changes in the optimum, as well as to changes in the strength of stabilizing selection. Our approximations are surprisingly accurate, even for systems with as few as 5 loci. We find that when the effects of drift are included, the expected genetic variance is hardly altered by directional selection, even though it fluctuates in any particular instance. We also find hysteresis, showing that even after averaging over the microscopic variables, the macroscopic trajectories retain a memory of the underlying genetic states. },

abstract = {Mutation rates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genomes have been estimated using purified reverse transcriptase or single-round infection system. Since small sequences were used as templates, the overall mutation rates could only be extrapolated and the biological significance of mutations is unknown. For direct estimation of HIV-1 mutation rates and understanding of the potential biological influences of mutations, we obtained 19 complete or nearly full-length proviral genomes from single-round-infected adherent cells of lymphocytes by using a lambda phage library method and a long-range PCR technique. Analysis of 160,000 bp of sequences showed that the overall mutation rate of HIV-1 genomes was 5.4 x 10(-5) per base per replication cycle. On average, 1.1 mutations (range, 0 to 3) were generated in each viral genome during one infection cycle. Inspection of the mutations in the HIV-1 genome revealed that all site mutations within protein-coding regions were nonsynonymous mutations. Among all mutations, half were deleterious (premature stop codon and deletions) and would result in defective genomes. By applying the same system to an HIV-1 genome with a G262A mutation in the thumb region of the reverse transcriptase, a significant increase was observed in deletion and insertion mutation rates but no increase in the overall mutation rate in viral genomes was found.},

title = {Structure of the light chain-binding domain of myosin V},
abstract = {Myosin V is a double-headed molecular motor involved in organelle transport. Two distinctive features of this motor, processivity and the ability to take extended linear steps of approx36 nm along the actin helical track, depend on its unusually long light chain-binding domain (LCBD). The LCBD of myosin V consists of six tandem IQ motifs, which constitute the binding sites for calmodulin (CaM) and CaM-like light chains. Here, we report the 2-A resolution crystal structure of myosin light chain 1 (Mlc1p) bound to the IQ2-IQ3 fragment of Myo2p, a myosin V from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This structure, combined with FRET distance measurements between probes in various CaM-IQ complexes, comparative sequence analysis, and the previously determined structures of Mlc1p-IQ2 and Mlc1p-IQ4, allowed building a model of the LCBD of myosin V. The IQs of myosin V are distributed into three pairs. There appear to be specific cooperative interactions between light chains within each IQ pair, but little or no interaction between pairs, providing flexibility at their junctions. The second and third IQ pairs each present a light chain, whether CaM or a CaM-related molecule, bound in a noncanonical extended conformation in which the N-lobe does not interact with the IQ motif. The resulting free N-lobes may engage in protein-protein interactions. The extended conformation is characteristic of the single IQ of myosin VI and is common throughout the myosin superfamily. The model points to a prominent role of the LCBD in the function, regulation, and molecular interactions of myosin V.},

title = {Population genomic inference of recombination rates and hotspots},
abstract = {As more human genomic data become available, fine-scale recombination rate variation can be inferred on a genome-wide scale. Current statistical methods to infer recombination rates that can be applied to moderate, or large, genomic regions are limited to approximated likelihoods. Here, we develop a Bayesian full-likelihood method using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to estimate background recombination rates and hotspots. The probability model is inspired by the observed patterns of recombination at several genomic regions analyzed in sperm-typing studies. Posterior probabilities and Bayes factors of recombination hotspots along chromosomes are inferred. For moderate-size genomic regions (e.g., with <100 SNPs), the full-likelihood method is used. Larger regions are split into subintervals (typically each having between 20 and 50 markers). The likelihood is approximated based on the genealogies for each subinterval. The background recombination rates, hotspots, and parameters are evaluated by using a parallel computing approach and assuming shared parameters across the subintervals. Simulation analyses show that our method can accurately estimate the variation in recombination rates across genomic regions. In particular, clusters of hotspots can be distinguished even though weaker hotspots are present. The method is applied to SNP data from the HLA region, the MS32, and chromosome 19.},

abstract = {Describing at a genomic scale how mutations in different genes influence one another is essential to the understanding of how genotype correlates with phenotype and remains a major challenge in biology. Previous studies pointed out the need for accurate measurements of not only synthetic but also buffering interactions in the characterization of genetic networks and functional modules. We developed a sensitive and efficient method that allows such measurements at a genomic scale in yeast. In a pilot experiment (41 genome-wide screens), we quantified the fitness of 140,000 double deletion strains relative to the corresponding single mutants and identified many genetic interactions. In addition to synthetic growth defects (validated experimentally with factors newly identified as genetically interfering with mRNA degradation), most of the identified genetic interactions measured weak epistatic effects. These weak effects, rarely meaningful when considered individually, were crucial to defining specific signatures for many gene deletions and had a major contribution in defining clusters of functionally related genes.},

title = {The role of epistatic gene interactions in the response to selection and the evolution of evolvability},
abstract = {It has been argued that the architecture of the genotype-phenotype map determines evolvability, but few studies have attempted to quantify these effects. In this article we use the multilinear epistatic model to study the effects of different forms of epistasis on the response to directional selection. We derive an analytical prediction for the change in the additive genetic variance, and use individual-based simulations to understand the dynamics of evolvability and the evolution of genetic architecture. This shows that the major determinant for the evolution of the additive variance, and thus the evolvability, is directional epistasis. Positive directional epistasis leads to an acceleration of evolvability, while negative directional epistasis leads to canalization. In contrast, pure non-directional epistasis has little effect on the response to selection. One consequence of this is that the classical epistatic variance components, which do not distinguish directional and non-directional effects, are useless as predictors of evolutionary dynamics. The build-up of linkage disequilibrium also has negligible effects. We argue that directional epistasis is likely to have major effects on evolutionary dynamics and should be the focus of empirical studies of epistasis.},

abstract = {Evolution of gene regulation is an important contributor to the variety of life. Here, we analyse the evolution of a combinatorial transcriptional circuit composed of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that are conserved among all eukaryotes. This circuit regulates mating in the ascomycete yeast lineage. We first identify a group of mating genes that was transcriptionally regulated by an activator in a fungal ancestor, but is now transcriptionally regulated by a repressor in modern bakers' yeast. Despite this change in regulatory mechanism, the logical output of the overall circuit remains the same. By examining the regulation of mating in modern yeasts that are related to different extents, we deduce specific, sequential changes in both cis- and trans-regulatory elements that constitute the transition from positive to negative regulation. These changes indicate specific mechanisms by which fitness barriers were traversed during the transition.},

title = {B-S transition in short oligonucleotides},
abstract = {Stretching experiments with long double-stranded DNA molecules in physiological ambient revealed a force-induced transition at a force of 65 pN. During this transition between B-DNA and highly overstretched S-DNA the DNA lengthens by a factor of 1.7 of its B-form contour length. Here, we report the occurrence of this so-called B-S transition in short duplexes consisting of 30 basepairs. We employed atomic-force-microscope-based single molecule force spectroscopy to explore the unbinding mechanism of two short duplexes containing 30 or 20 basepairs by pulling at the opposite 5' termini. For a 30-basepair-long DNA duplex the B-S transition is expected to cause a length increase of 6.3 nm and should therefore be detectable. Indeed 30% of the measured force-extension curves exhibit a region of constant force (plateau) at 65 pN, which corresponds to the B-S transition. The observed plateaus show a length between 3 and 7 nm. This plateau length distribution indicates that the dissociation of a 30-basepair duplex mainly occurs during the B-S transition. In contrast, the measured force-extension curves for a 20-basepair DNA duplex exhibited rupture forces below 65 pN and did not show any evidence of a B-S transition.},

title = {High Multiplicity Infection by HIV-1 in Men Who Have Sex with Men},
abstract = {Elucidating virus-host interactions responsible for HIV-1 transmission is important for advancing HIV-1 prevention strategies. To this end, single genome amplification (SGA) and sequencing of HIV-1 within the context of a model of random virus evolution has made possible for the first time an unambiguous identification of transmitted/founder viruses and a precise estimation of their numbers. Here, we applied this approach to HIV-1 env analyses in a cohort of acutely infected men who have sex with men (MSM) and found that a high proportion (10 of 28; 36%) had been productively infected by more than one virus. In subjects with multivariant transmission, the minimum number of transmitted viruses ranged from 2 to 10 with viral recombination leading to rapid and extensive genetic shuffling among virus lineages. A combined analysis of these results, together with recently published findings based on identical SGA methods in largely heterosexual (HSX) cohorts, revealed a significantly higher frequency of multivariant transmission in MSM than in HSX [19 of 50 subjects (38%) versus 34 of 175 subjects (19%); Fisher's exact p = 0.008]. To further evaluate the SGA strategy for identifying transmitted/founder viruses, we analyzed 239 overlapping 5' and 3' half genome or env-only sequences from plasma viral RNA (vRNA) and blood mononuclear cell DNA in an MSM subject who had a particularly well-documented virus exposure history 3-6 days before symptom onset and 14-17 days before peak plasma viremia (47,600,000 vRNA molecules/ml). All 239 sequences coalesced to a single transmitted/founder virus genome in a time frame consistent with the clinical history, and a molecular clone of this genome encoded replication competent virus in accord with model predictions. Higher multiplicity of HIV-1 infection in MSM compared with HSX is consistent with the demonstrably higher epidemiological risk of virus acquisition in MSM and could indicate a greater challenge for HIV-1 vaccines than previously recognized.},

title = {Interactions among quantitative traits in the course of sympatric speciation},
abstract = {Sympatric speciation, the origin of two or more species from a single local population, has almost certainly been involved in formation of several species flocks, and may be fairly common in nature. The most straightforward scenario for sympatric speciation requires disruptive selection favouring two substantially different phenotypes, and consists of the evolution of reproductive isolation between them followed by the elimination of all intermediate phenotypes. Here we use the hypergeometric phenotypic model to show that sympatric speciation is possible even when fitness and mate choice depend on different quantitative traits, so that speciation must involve formation of covariance between these traits. The increase in the number of variable loci affecting fitness facilitates sympatric speciation, whereas the increase in the number of variable loci affecting mate choice has the opposite effect. These predictions may enable more cases of sympatric speciation to be identified.},

title = {The evolutionary origin of complex features},
abstract = {A long-standing challenge to evolutionary theory has been whether it can explain the origin of complex organismal features. We examined this issue using digital organisms--computer programs that self-replicate, mutate, compete and evolve. Populations of digital organisms often evolved the ability to perform complex logic functions requiring the coordinated execution of many genomic instructions. Complex functions evolved by building on simpler functions that had evolved earlier, provided that these were also selectively favoured. However, no particular intermediate stage was essential for evolving complex functions. The first genotypes able to perform complex functions differed from their non-performing parents by only one or two mutations, but differed from the ancestor by many mutations that were also crucial to the new functions. In some cases, mutations that were deleterious when they appeared served as stepping-stones in the evolution of complex features. These findings show how complex functions can originate by random mutation and natural selection.},

abstract = {Drug resistance has sharply limited the effectiveness of HIV-1 protease inhibitors in AIDS therapy. It is critically important to understand the basis of this resistance for designing new drugs. We have evaluated the free energy contribution of each residue in the HIV protease in binding to one of its substrates and to the five FDA-approved protease drugs. Analysis of these free energy profiles and the variability at each sequence position suggests: (i) single drug resistance mutations are likely to occur at not well conserved residues if they interact more favorably with drugs than with the substrate; and (ii) resistance-evading drugs should have a free energy profile similar to the substrate and interact most favorably with well conserved residues. We also propose an empirical parameter, called the free energy/variability value, which combines free energy calculation and sequence analysis to suggest possible drug resistance mutations on the protease. The free energy/variability value is defined as the product of one residue's contribution to the binding free energy and the variability of that residue. This parameter can assist in designing resistance-evading drugs for any target.},

title = {Variability at human immunodeficiency virus type 1 subtype C protease cleavage sites: an indication of viral fitness?},
abstract = {Naturally occurring polymorphisms in the protease of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C would be expected to lead to adaptive (compensatory) changes in protease cleavage sites. To test this hypothesis, we examined the prevalences and patterns of cleavage site polymorphisms in the Gag, Gag-Pol, and Nef cleavage sites of C compared to those in non-C subtypes. Codon-based maximum-likelihood methods were used to assess the natural selection and evolutionary history of individual cleavage sites. Seven cleavage sites (p17/p24, p24/p2, NC/p1, NC/TFP, PR/RT, RT/p66, and p66/IN) were well conserved over time and in all HIV-1 subtypes. One site (p1/p6(gag)) exhibited moderate variation, and four sites (p2/NC, TFP/p6(pol), p6(pol)/PR, and Nef) were highly variable, both within and between subtypes. Three of the variable sites are known to be major determinants of polyprotein processing and virion production. P2/NC controls the rate and order of cleavage, p6(gag) is an important phosphoprotein required for virion release, and TFP/p6(pol), a novel cleavage site in the transframe domain, influences the specificity of Gag-Pol processing and the activation of protease. Overall, 58.3% of the 12 HIV-1 cleavage sites were significantly more diverse in C than in B viruses. When analyzed as a single concatenated fragment of 360 bp, 96.0% of group M cleavage site sequences fell into subtype-specific phylogenetic clusters, suggesting that they coevolved with the virus. Natural variation at C cleavage sites may play an important role, not only in regulation of the viral cycle but also in disease progression and response to therapy.},

abstract = {The selective advantage of an allele Gi (relative to the mean of alleles at this locus) is given by (formula: see text) in which Ai is the average excess of the allele on the character, X; W(X) is the fitness function; F(X) is the frequency function; W is the mean fitness; and the prime denotes differentiation. With truncation selection si = AaF(C)/w in which F(C) is the ordinate at the culling level and w is the proportion saved; this does not depend on any assumption about the distribution of F(X). If the character is normally distributed, si = AiI/sigma2, in which I is the selection differential and sigma2 is the variance of the character distribution. Finally, if the logarithm of the fitness is proportional to the squared deviation from the optimum and the character is distributed normally, si = AiK(Xop--m), in which Xop is the optimum value of the character, m is the mean value, and K is a constant determined by the variances of the fitness function and the frequency function. Truncation is the most efficient form of directional selection in the sense of producing the maximum gene frequency change for a given effect of the gene on the character, but fitness functions can depart considerably from sharp truncation without greatly reducing the efficiency.},

title = {Perspective: A Critique of Sewall Wright's Shifting Balance Theory of Evolution},
abstract = {We evaluate Sewall Wright's three-phase 'shifting balance' theory of evolution, examining both the theoretical issues and the relevant data from nature and the laboratory. We conclude that while phases I and II of Wright's theory (the movement of populations from one 'adaptive peak' to another via drift and selection) can occur under some conditions, genetic drift is often unnecessary for movement between peaks. Phase III of the shifting balance, in which adaptations spread from particular populations to the entire species, faces two major theoretical obstacles: (1) unlike adaptations favored by simple directional selection, adaptations whose fixation requires some genetic drift are often prevented from spreading by barriers to gene flow; and (2) it is difficult to assemble complex adaptations whose constituent parts arise via peak shifts in different demes. Our review of the data from nature shows that although there is some evidence for individual phases of the shifting balance process, there are few empirical observations explained better by Wright's three-phase mechanism than by simple mass selection. Similarly, artificial selection experiments fail to show that selection in subdivided populations produces greater response than does mass selection in large populations. The complexity of the shifting balance process and the difficulty of establishing that adaptive valleys have been crossed by genetic drift make it impossible to test Wright's claim that adaptations commonly originate by this process. In view of these problems, it seems unreasonable to consider the shifting balance process as an important explanation for the evolution of adaptations.},

title = {Force-Dependent Stepping Kinetics of Myosin-V},
abstract = {Myosin-V is a processive two-headed actin-based motor protein involved in many intracellular transport processes. A key question for understanding myosin-V function and the communication between its two heads is its behavior under load. Since in vivo myosin-V colocalizes with other much stronger motors like kinesins, its behavior under superstall forces is especially relevant. We used optical tweezers with a long-range force feedback to study myosin-V motion under controlled external forward and backward loads over its full run length. We find the mean step size remains constant at [~]36 nm over a wide range of forces from 5 pN forward to 1.5 pN backward load. We also find two force-dependent transitions in the chemomechanical cycle. The slower ADP-release is rate limiting at low loads and depends only weakly on force. The faster rate depends more strongly on force. The stronger force dependence suggests this rate represents the diffusive search of the leading head for its binding site. In contrast to kinesin motors, myosin-V's run length is essentially independent of force between 5 pN of forward to 1.5 pN of backward load. At superstall forces of 5 pN, we observe continuous backward stepping of myosin-V, indicating that a force-driven reversal of the power stroke is possible.},

title = {Interpreting the effect of vaccination on steady state infection in animals challenged with Simian immunodeficiency virus},
abstract = {A representative vaccinated macaque challenged with SIVmac251 establishes a persistent infection with a lower virus load, higher CTL frequencies, and much higher helper cell frequencies, than a representative control animal. The reasons for the difference are not fully understood. Here we interpret this effect using a mathematical model we developed recently to explain results of various experiments on virus and CTL dynamics in SIV-infected macaques and HIV-infected humans. The model includes two types of cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) regulated by antigen-activated helper cells and directly by infected cells, respectively, and predicts the existence of two steady states with different viremia, helper cell and CTL levels. Depending on the initial level of CTL memory cells and helper cells, a representative animal ends up in either the high-virus state or the low-virus state, which accounts for the observed differences between the two animal groups. Viremia in the low-virus state is proportional to the antigen sensitivity threshold of helper cells. Estimating the infectivity ratio of activated and resting CD4 T cells at 200-300, the correct range for the critical memory cell percentage and the viremia peak suppression is predicted. However, the model does not explain why viremia in the "low-virus state" is surprisingly high , relative to vaccinated animals infected with SHIV, and broadly distributed among challenged animals. We conclude that the model needs an update explaining extremely low sensitivity of uninfected helper cells to antigen in vaccinated animals.},

title = {Chance and necessity in the evolution of minimal metabolic networks},
abstract = {It is possible to infer aspects of an organism's lifestyle from its gene content. Can the reverse also be done? Here we consider this issue by modelling evolution of the reduced genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria. The diversity of gene content in these bacteria may reflect both variation in selective forces and contingency-dependent loss of alternative pathways. Using an in silico representation of the metabolic network of Escherichia coli, we examine the role of contingency by repeatedly simulating the successive loss of genes while controlling for the environment. The minimal networks that result are variable in both gene content and number. Partially different metabolisms can thus evolve owing to contingency alone. The simulation outcomes do preserve a core metabolism, however, which is over-represented in strict intracellular bacteria. Moreover, differences between minimal networks based on lifestyle are predictable: by simulating their respective environmental conditions, we can model evolution of the gene content in Buchnera aphidicola and Wigglesworthia glossinidia with over 80% accuracy. We conclude that, at least for the particular cases considered here, gene content of an organism can be predicted with knowledge of its distant ancestors and its current lifestyle.},

Tentative generalizations about evolutionary processes across species are beginning to emerge, as well as contrasting patterns that characterize different groups of organisms. Furthermore, recent technical advances now allow the combination of ecological measurements of selection in natural environments with population genetic analysis of cloned QTLs, promising advances in identifying the evolutionary processes that influence natural genetic variation.},

title = {The evolution of recombination: removing the limits to natural selection},
abstract = {One of the oldest hypotheses for the advantage of recombination is that recombination allows beneficial mutations that arise in different individuals to be placed together on the same chromosome. Unless recombination occurs, one of the beneficial alleles is doomed to extinction, slowing the rate at which adaptive mutations are incorporated within a population. We model the effects of a modifier of recombination on the fixation probability of beneficial mutations when beneficial alleles are segregating at other loci. We find that modifier alleles that increase recombination do increase the fixation probability of beneficial mutants and subsequently hitchhike along as the mutants rise in frequency. The strength of selection favoring a modifier that increases recombination is proportional to lambda(2)S delta r/r when linkage is tight and lambda(2)S3 delta r/N when linkage is loose, where lambda is the beneficial mutation rate per genome per generation throughout a population of size N, S is the average mutant effect, r is the average recombination rate, and delta r is the amount that recombination is modified. We conclude that selection for recombination will be substantial only if there is tight linkage within the genome or if many loci are subject to directional selection as during periods of rapid evolutionary change.},

abstract = { Different sets of metastable states can be reached in glassy systems below some transition temperature depending on initial conditions and details of the dynamics. This is investigated for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass model with long ranged interactions. In particular, the time dependent local field distribution and energy are calculated for zero temperature. This is done for a system quenched to zero temperature, slow cooling or simulated annealing, a greedy algorithm and repeated tapping. Results are obtained from Monte-Carlo simulations and a Master-Fokker-Planck approach. A comparison with replica symmetry broken theory, evaluated in high orders, shows that the energies obtained via dynamics are higher than the ground state energy of replica theory. Tapping and simulated annealing yield on the other hand results which are very close to the ground state energy. The local field distribution tends to zero for small fields. This is in contrast to the Edwards flat measure hypothesis. The distribution of energies obtained for different tapping strengths does again not follow the canonical form proposed by Edwards. },

title = {Quantifying the evolutionary dynamics of language},
abstract = {Human language is based on grammatical rules. Cultural evolution allows these rules to change over time. Rules compete with each other: as new rules rise to prominence, old ones die away. To quantify the dynamics of language evolution, we studied the regularization of English verbs over the past 1,200 years. Although an elaborate system of productive conjugations existed in English's proto-Germanic ancestor, Modern English uses the dental suffix, '-ed', to signify past tense. Here we describe the emergence of this linguistic rule amidst the evolutionary decay of its exceptions, known to us as irregular verbs. We have generated a data set of verbs whose conjugations have been evolving for more than a millennium, tracking inflectional changes to 177 Old-English irregular verbs. Of these irregular verbs, 145 remained irregular in Middle English and 98 are still irregular today. We study how the rate of regularization depends on the frequency of word usage. The half-life of an irregular verb scales as the square root of its usage frequency: a verb that is 100 times less frequent regularizes 10 times as fast. Our study provides a quantitative analysis of the regularization process by which ancestral forms gradually yield to an emerging linguistic rule.},

title = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 env sequences from Calcutta in eastern India: identification of features that distinguish subtype C sequences in India from other subtype C sequences},
abstract = {India is experiencing a rapid spread of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), primarily through heterosexual transmission of subtype C viruses. To delineate the molecular features of HIV-1 circulating in India, we sequenced the V3-V4 region of viral env from 21 individuals attending an HIV clinic in Calcutta, the most populous city in the eastern part of the country, and analyzed these and the other Indian sequences in the HIV database. Twenty individuals were infected with viruses having a subtype C env, and one had viruses with a subtype A env. Analyses of 192 subtype C sequences that included one sequence for each subject from this study and from the HIV database revealed that almost all sequences from India, along with a small number from other countries, form a phylogenetically distinct lineage within subtype C, which we designate C(IN). Overall, C(IN) lineage sequences were more closely related to each other (level of diversity, 10.2%) than to subtype C sequences from Botswana, Burundi, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe (range, 15.3 to 20.7%). Of the three positions identified as signature amino acid substitution sites for C(IN) sequences (K340E, K350A, and G429E), 56% of the C(IN) sequences contained all three amino acids while 87% of the sequences contained at least two of these substitutions. Among the non-C(IN) sequences, all three amino acids were present in 2%, while 22% contained two or more of these amino acids. These results suggest that much of the current Indian epidemic is descended from a single introduction into the country. Identification of conserved signature amino acid positions could assist epidemiologic tracking and has implications for the development of a vaccine against subtype C HIV-1 in India.},

The genomes of 12 Drosophila species, ten of which are presented here for the first time (sechellia, simulans, yakuba, erecta, ananassae, persimilis, willistoni, mojavensis, virilis and grimshawi), illustrate how rates and patterns of sequence divergence across taxa can illuminate evolutionary processes on a genomic scale. These genome sequences augment the formidable genetic tools that have made Drosophila melanogaster a pre-eminent model for animal genetics, and will further catalyse fundamental research on mechanisms of development, cell biology, genetics, disease, neurobiology, behaviour, physiology and evolution. Despite remarkable similarities among these Drosophila species, we identified many putatively non-neutral changes in protein-coding genes, non-coding RNA genes, and cis-regulatory regions. These may prove to underlie differences in the ecology and behaviour of these diverse species.},

abstract = {Using perturbation techniques, I study the equilibrium of deterministic discrete time multilocus models with weak epistasis. The most important results are on the relationship between epistasis and disequilibrium. Disequilibrium involving a particular set of loci reflects only epistasis simultaneously involving those loci. Moreover, all the disequilibria of all orders vary approximately as the inverse of the probability of at least one recombination event among the loci involved. Finally, higher order disequilibria among loci will be lower than lower order ones, even if the level of epistasis is the same at all orders. In this sense, the unit of selection is small. However, given the larger number of higher order disequilibria, these higher order disequilibria may play an important role in the computation of gametic frequencies from allelic frequencies in models with a large number of loci. Finally, I show that epistasis between blocks of loci will be averages of epistatic effects, not additions of epistatic effects. Thus, failure to find significant epistasis on a chromosomal basis does not rule out the importance of epistatic effects.},

abstract = {We extend the exact multilocal renormalization group (RG) method to study the flow of the effective action functional. This important physical quantity satisfies an exact RG equation which is then expanded in multilocal components. Integrating the nonlocal parts yields a closed exact RG equation for the local part, to a given order in the local part. The method is illustrated on the O(N) model by straightforwardly recovering the eta exponent and scaling functions. Then it is applied to study the glass phase of the Cardy-Ostlund, random phase sine Gordon model near the glass transition temperature. The static correlations and equilibrium dynamical exponent z are recovered and several results are obtained, such as the equilibrium two-point scaling functions. The nonequilibrium, finite momentum, two-time t,t' response and correlations are computed. They are shown to exhibit scaling forms, characterized by exponents lambda(R) not equal lambda(C), as well as universal scaling functions that we compute. The fluctuation dissipation ratio is found to be nontrivial and of the form X[q(z)(t-t'),t/t']. Analogies and differences with pure critical models are discussed.},

abstract = {The analysis of evolutionary rates is a popular approach to characterizing the effect of natural selection at the molecular level. Sequences contributing to species adaptation are expected to evolve faster than nonfunctional sequences because favourable mutations have a higher fixation probability than neutral ones. Such an accelerated rate of evolution might be due to factors other than natural selection, in particular GC-biased gene conversion. This is true of neutral sequences, but also of constrained sequences, which can be illustrated using the mouse Fxy gene. Several criteria can discriminate between the natural selection and biased gene conversion models. These criteria suggest that the recently reported human accelerated regions are most likely the result of biased gene conversion. We argue that these regions, far from contributing to human adaptation, might represent the Achilles' heel of our genome.},

abstract = {The evolution of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) during chronic infection involves the rapid, continuous turnover of genetic diversity. However, the role of natural selection, relative to random genetic drift, in governing this process is unclear. We tested a stochastic model of genetic drift using partial envelope sequences sampled longitudinally in 28 infected children. In each case the Bayesian posterior (empirical) distribution of coalescent genealogies was estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Posterior predictive simulation was then used to generate a null distribution of genealogies assuming neutrality, with the null and empirical distributions compared using four genealogy-based summary statistics sensitive to nonneutral evolution. Because both null and empirical distributions were generated within a coalescent framework, we were able to explicitly account for the confounding influence of demography. From the distribution of corrected P-values across patients, we conclude that empirical genealogies are more asymmetric than expected if evolution is driven by mutation and genetic drift only, with an excess of low-frequency polymorphisms in the population. This indicates that although drift may still play an important role, natural selection has a strong influence on the evolution of HIV-1 envelope. A negative relationship between effective population size and substitution rate indicates that as the efficacy of selection increases, a smaller proportion of mutations approach fixation in the population. This suggests the presence of deleterious mutations. We therefore conclude that intrahost HIV-1 evolution in envelope is dominated by purifying selection against low-frequency deleterious mutations that do not reach fixation.},

abstract = {The genome organizations of eight phylogenetically distinct species from five mammalian orders were compared in order to address fundamental questions relating to mammalian chromosomal evolution. Rates of chromosome evolution within mammalian orders were found to increase since the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. Nearly 20% of chromosome breakpoint regions were reused during mammalian evolution; these reuse sites are also enriched for centromeres. Analysis of gene content in and around evolutionary breakpoint regions revealed increased gene density relative to the genome-wide average. We found that segmental duplications populate the majority of primate-specific breakpoints and often flank inverted chromosome segments, implicating their role in chromosomal rearrangement.},

abstract = {The sequencing of the 12 genomes of members of the genus Drosophila was taken as an opportunity to reevaluate the genetic and physical maps for 11 of the species, in part to aid in the mapping of assembled scaffolds. Here, we present an overview of the importance of cytogenetic maps to Drosophila biology and to the concepts of chromosomal evolution. Physical and genetic markers were used to anchor the genome assembly scaffolds to the polytene chromosomal maps for each species. In addition, a computational approach was used to anchor smaller scaffolds on the basis of the analysis of syntenic blocks. We present the chromosomal map data from each of the 11 sequenced non-Drosophila melanogaster species as a series of sections. Each section reviews the history of the polytene chromosome maps for each species, presents the new polytene chromosome maps, and anchors the genomic scaffolds to the cytological maps using genetic and physical markers. The mapping data agree with Muller's idea that the majority of Drosophila genes are syntenic. Despite the conservation of genes within homologous chromosome arms across species, the karyotypes of these species have changed through the fusion of chromosomal arms followed by subsequent rearrangement events.},

But Darwin himself recognized that certain biological features could limit this effectiveness, features that generally reduce the efficiency of natural selection or yield suboptimal adaptation. Genetic linkage is known to be one such feature, and here we show theoretically that it can introduce a more sinister flaw: when there is complete linkage between loci affecting fitness and loci affecting mutation rate, positive natural selection and recurrent mutation can drive mutation rates in an adapting population to intolerable levels. We discuss potential implications of this finding for the early establishment of recombination, the evolutionary fate of asexual populations, and immunological clearance of clonal pathogens.},

abstract = {By impairing both function and survival, the severe reduction in oxygen availability associated with high-altitude environments is likely to act as an agent of natural selection. We used genomic and candidate gene approaches to search for evidence of such genetic selection. First, a genome-wide allelic differentiation scan (GWADS) comparing indigenous highlanders of the Tibetan Plateau (3,200-3,500 m) with closely related lowland Han revealed a genome-wide significant divergence across eight SNPs located near EPAS1. This gene encodes the transcription factor HIF2alpha, which stimulates production of red blood cells and thus increases the concentration of hemoglobin in blood. Second, in a separate cohort of Tibetans residing at 4,200 m, we identified 31 EPAS1 SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium that correlated significantly with hemoglobin concentration. The sex-adjusted hemoglobin concentration was, on average, 0.8 g/dL lower in the major allele homozygotes compared with the heterozygotes. These findings were replicated in a third cohort of Tibetans residing at 4,300 m. The alleles associating with lower hemoglobin concentrations were correlated with the signal from the GWADS study and were observed at greatly elevated frequencies in the Tibetan cohorts compared with the Han. High hemoglobin concentrations are a cardinal feature of chronic mountain sickness offering one plausible mechanism for selection. Alternatively, as EPAS1 is pleiotropic in its effects, selection may have operated on some other aspect of the phenotype. Whichever of these explanations is correct, the evidence for genetic selection at the EPAS1 locus from the GWADS study is supported by the replicated studies associating function with the allelic variants.},

abstract = {A SNP in the gene encoding lactase (LCT) (C/T-13910) is associated with the ability to digest milk as adults (lactase persistence) in Europeans, but the genetic basis of lactase persistence in Africans was previously unknown. We conducted a genotype-phenotype association study in 470 Tanzanians, Kenyans and Sudanese and identified three SNPs (G/C-14010, T/G-13915 and C/G-13907) that are associated with lactase persistence and that have derived alleles that significantly enhance transcription from the LCT promoter in vitro. These SNPs originated on different haplotype backgrounds from the European C/T-13910 SNP and from each other. Genotyping across a 3-Mb region demonstrated haplotype homozygosity extending >2.0 Mb on chromosomes carrying C-14010, consistent with a selective sweep over the past approximately 7,000 years. These data provide a marked example of convergent evolution due to strong selective pressure resulting from shared cultural traits-animal domestication and adult milk consumption.},

title = {Percolation on the fitness hypercube and the evolution of reproductive isolation},
abstract = {We study the structure and properties of adaptive landscapes arising from the assumption that genotype fitness can only be 0 (inviable genotype) or 1 (viable genotype). An appropriate image of resulting ("holey") fitness landscapes is a (multidimensional) flat surface with many holes. We have demonstrated that in the genotype space there are clusters of viable genotypes whose members can evolve from any member by single substitutions and that there are "species" defined according to the biological species concept. Assuming that the number of genes, n, is very large while the proportion of viable genotypes among all possible genotypes, p, is very small, we have deduced many qualitative and quantitative properties of holey adaptive landscapes which may be related to the patterns of speciation. Relationship between p and n determines two qualitatively different regimes: subcritical and supercritical. The subcritical regime takes place if p is extremely small. In this case, the largest clusters of viable genotypes in the genotype space have size of order n and there are many of such size; typical members of a cluster are connected by a single ("evolutionary") path; the number of different (biological) species in the cluster has order n; the expected number of different species in the cluster within k viable substitutions from any its member is of order k. The supercritical regime takes place if p is small but not extremely small. In this case, there exists a cluster of viable genotypes (a "giant" component) that has size of order 2n/n; the giant component comes "near" every point of the genotype space; typical members of the giant component are connected by many evolutionary paths; the number of different (biological) species on the "giant" component has at least order n2; the expected number of different species on the "giant" component within k viable substitution from any its member is at least of order kn. At the boundary of two regimes all properties of adaptive landscapes undergo dramatic changes, a physical analogy of which is a phase transition. We have considered the most probable (within the present framework) scenario of biological evolution on holey landscapes assuming that it starts on a genotype from the largest connected component and proceeds along it by mutation and genetic drift. In this scenario, there is no need to cross any "adaptive valleys"; reproductive isolation between populations evolves as a side effect of accumulating different mutations. The rate of divergence is very fast: a few substitutions are sufficient to result in a new biological species. We argue that macroevolution and speciation on "rugged" fitness landscapes proceed according to the properties of the corresponding holey landscapes.},

abstract = {Fine-scale estimation of recombination rates remains a challenging problem. Experimental techniques can provide accurate estimates at fine scales but are technically challenging and cannot be applied on a genome-wide scale. An alternative source of information comes from patterns of genetic variation. Several statistical methods have been developed to estimate recombination rates from randomly sampled chromosomes. However, most such methods either make poor assumptions about recombination rate variation, or simply assume that there is no rate variation. Since the discovery of recombination hotspots, it is clear that recombination rates can vary over many orders of magnitude at the fine scale. We present a method for the estimation of recombination rates in the presence of recombination hotspots. We demonstrate that the method is able to detect and accurately quantify recombination rate heterogeneity, and is a substantial improvement over a commonly used method. We then use the method to reanalyze genetic variation data from the HLA and MS32 regions of the human genome and demonstrate that the method is able to provide accurate rate estimates and simultaneously detect hotspots.},

abstract = {Within-patient HIV evolution reflects the strong selection pressure driving viral escape from cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) recognition. Whether this intrapatient accumulation of escape mutations translates into HIV evolution at the population level has not been evaluated. We studied over 300 patients drawn from the B- and C-clade epidemics, focusing on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles HLA-B57 and HLA-B5801, which are associated with long-term HIV control and are therefore likely to exert strong selection pressure on the virus. The CTL response dominating acute infection in HLA-B57/5801-positive subjects drove positive selection of an escape mutation that reverted to wild-type after transmission to HLA-B57/5801-negative individuals. A second escape mutation within the epitope, by contrast, was maintained after transmission. These data show that the process of accumulation of escape mutations within HIV is not inevitable. Complex epitope- and residue-specific selection forces, including CTL-mediated positive selection pressure and virus-mediated purifying selection, operate in tandem to shape HIV evolution at the population level.},

title = {Mechanistic features of recombination in HIV},
abstract = {The importance of recombination in retroviral evolution has been acknowledged for several decades. Consequently, after the identification of HIV as the etiological agent of AIDS, it was suspected that recombination could also play a central role in the evolution of this virus. However, only recently, extensive epidemiologic studies of HIV infections worldwide have provided an estimate for the occurrence of recombination in vivo, unveiling recombination frequencies that dwarf those initially expected. Nowadays, recombination is regarded as an integral part of the infectious cycle of this retrovirus, which impacts on diagnosis and treatment of infections, especially when genetically distant viruses have been at the origin of the recombinant forms. Retroviral recombination is observed when two genetically divergent genomic RNA molecules are present in the same viral particle, and arises during the reverse transcription step. This review focuses on the mechanisms that have been proposed to account for the occurrence of recombination in retroviruses, from the strand displacement model, according to which recombination occurs during second DNA strand synthesis; to the description of the factors responsible for copy-choice recombination during first DNA strand synthesis, such as the presence of breaks, pause sites, or secondary structures in the genomic RNA. Most of these models have been supported by experimental data obtained from in vitro reconstituted systems or from cell infection studies using academic model sequences. The situation in vivo is expected to be more complex, since several factors come into play when recombination involves relatively distant isolates, as in the case of inter-subtype recombination. At present, it is clear that further studies are needed in order to evaluate whether a prevailing mechanism exists for in vivo recombination, and these studies will also be essential for understanding how the underlying mechanisms of recombination contribute to the evolution of HIV.},

title = {Direct observation of DNA bending/unbending kinetics in complex with DNA-bending protein IHF},
abstract = {Regulation of gene expression involves formation of specific protein-DNA complexes in which the DNA is often bent or sharply kinked. Kinetics measurements of DNA bending when in complex with the protein are essential for understanding the molecular mechanism that leads to precise recognition of specific DNA-binding sites. Previous kinetics measurements on several DNA-bending proteins used stopped-flow techniques that have limited time resolution of few milliseconds. Here we use a nanosecond laser temperature-jump apparatus to probe, with submillisecond time resolution, the kinetics of bending/unbending of a DNA substrate bound to integration host factor (IHF), an architectural protein from Escherichia coli. The kinetics are monitored with time-resolved FRET, with the DNA substrates end-labeled with a FRET pair. The temperature-jump measurements, in combination with stopped-flow measurements, demonstrate that the binding of IHF to its cognate DNA site involves an intermediate state with straight or, possibly, partially bent DNA. The DNA bending rates range from approx2 ms-1 at approx37degreesC to approx40 ms-1 at approx10degreesC and correspond to an activation energy of approx14 +/- 3 kcal/mol. These rates and activation energy are similar to those of a single A:T base pair opening inside duplex DNA. Thus, our results suggest that spontaneous thermal disruption in base-paring, nucleated at an A:T site, may be sufficient to overcome the free energy barrier needed to partially bend/kink DNA before forming a tight complex with IHF.},

abstract = {Evolutionary pressures on proteins are often quantified by the ratio of substitution rates at non-synonymous and synonymous sites. The dN/dS ratio was originally developed for application to distantly diverged sequences, the differences among which represent substitutions that have fixed along independent lineages. Nevertheless, the dN/dS measure is often applied to sequences sampled from a single population, the differences among which represent segregating polymorphisms. Here, we study the expected dN/dS ratio for samples drawn from a single population under selection, and we find that in this context, dN/dS is relatively insensitive to the selection coefficient. Moreover, the hallmark signature of positive selection over divergent lineages, dN/dS>1, is violated within a population. For population samples, the relationship between selection and dN/dS does not follow a monotonic function, and so it may be impossible to infer selection pressures from dN/dS. These results have significant implications for the interpretation of dN/dS measurements among population-genetic samples.},

title = {Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer-Based Stoichiometry in Living Cells},
abstract = {Imaging of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescently labeled molecules can measure the timing and location of intermolecular interactions inside living cells. Present microscopic methods measure FRET in arbitrary units, and cannot discriminate FRET efficiency and the fractions of donor and acceptor in complex. Here we describe a stoichiometric method that uses three microscopic fluorescence images to measure FRET efficiency, the relative concentrations of donor and acceptor, and the fractions of donor and acceptor in complex in living cells. FRET stoichiometry derives from the concept that specific donor-acceptor complexes will give rise to a characteristic FRET efficiency, which, if measured, can allow stoichiometric discrimination of interacting components. A first equation determines FRET efficiency and the fraction of acceptor molecules in complex with donor. A second equation determines the fraction of donor molecules in complex by estimating the donor fluorescence lost due to energy transfer. This eliminates the need for acceptor photobleaching to determine total donor concentrations and allows for repeated measurements from the same cell. A third equation obtains the ratio of total acceptor to total donor molecules. The theory and method were confirmed by microscopic measurements of fluorescence from cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), citrine, and linked CFP-Citrine fusion protein, in solutions and inside cells. Together, the methods derived from these equations allow sensitive, rapid, and repeatable detection of donor-, acceptor-, and donor-acceptor complex stoichiometry at each pixel in an image. By accurately imaging molecular interactions, FRET stoichiometry opens new areas for quantitative study of intracellular molecular networks.},

title = {Insights into protein folding mechanisms from large scale analysis of mutational effects},
abstract = {Protein folding mechanisms are probed experimentally using single-point mutant perturbations. The relative effects on the folding (-values) and unfolding (1 - ) rates are used to infer the detailed structure of the transition-state ensemble (TSE). Here we analyze kinetic data on > 800 mutations carried out for 24 proteins with simple kinetic behavior. We find two surprising results: (i) all mutant effects are described by the equation: . Therefore all data are consistent with a single -value (0.24) with accuracy comparable to experimental precision, suggesting that the structural information in conventional -values is low. (ii) -values change with stability, increasing in mean value and spread from native to unfolding conditions, and thus cannot be interpreted without proper normalization. We eliminate stability effects calculating the -values at the mutant denaturation midpoints; i.e., conditions of zero stability ((0)). We then show that the intrinsic variability is (0) = 0.36 +/- 0.11, being somewhat larger for beta-sheet-rich proteins than for alpha-helical proteins. Importantly, we discover that (0)-values are proportional to how many of the residues surrounding the mutated site are local in sequence. High (0)-values correspond to protein surface sites, which have few nonlocal neighbors, whereas core residues with many tertiary interactions produce the lowest (0)-values. These results suggest a general mechanism in which the TSE at zero stability is a broad conformational ensemble stabilized by local interactions and without specific tertiary interactions, reconciling -values with many other empirical observations.},

title = {Architecture and secondary structure of an entire HIV-1 RNA genome},
abstract = {Single-stranded RNA viruses encompass broad classes of infectious agents and cause the common cold, cancer, AIDS and other serious health threats. Viral replication is regulated at many levels, including the use of conserved genomic RNA structures. Most potential regulatory elements in viral RNA genomes are uncharacterized. Here we report the structure of an entire HIV-1 genome at single nucleotide resolution using SHAPE, a high-throughput RNA analysis technology. The genome encodes protein structure at two levels. In addition to the correspondence between RNA and protein primary sequences, a correlation exists between high levels of RNA structure and sequences that encode inter-domain loops in HIV proteins. This correlation suggests that RNA structure modulates ribosome elongation to promote native protein folding. Some simple genome elements previously shown to be important, including the ribosomal gag-pol frameshift stem-loop, are components of larger RNA motifs. We also identify organizational principles for unstructured RNA regions, including splice site acceptors and hypervariable regions. These results emphasize that the HIV-1 genome and, potentially, many coding RNAs are punctuated by previously unrecognized regulatory motifs and that extensive RNA structure constitutes an important component of the genetic code.},

Comparisons of V4/V5 and V1/V2 population changes over the course of the study showed that major shifts in genetic populations frequently occurred in one region but not the other, and these observations were independently confirmed in one subject by single-genome sequencing.

From a study of 2448 genetically heterogeneous mice, we report the heritability of 88 complex traits that include models of human disease (asthma, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and anxiety) as well as immunological, biochemical, and hematological phenotypes. We show that environmental and physiological covariates are involved in an unexpectedly large number of significant interactions with genetic background. The 15 covariates we examined have a significant effect on behavioral and physiological tests, although they rarely explain >10% of the variation. We found that interaction effects are more frequent and larger than the main effects: half of the interactions explained >20% of the variance and in nine cases exceeded 50%. Our results indicate that assays of gene function using mouse models should take into account interactions between gene and environment.},

title = {FRET or No FRET: A Quantitative Comparison},
abstract = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a technique used to measure the interaction between two molecules labeled with two different fluorophores (the donor and the acceptor) by the transfer of energy from the excited donor to the acceptor. In biological applications, this technique has become popular to qualitatively map protein-protein interactions, and in biophysical projects it is used as a quantitative measure for distances between a single donor and acceptor molecule. Numerous approaches can be found in the literature to quantify and map FRET, but the measures they provide are often difficult to interpret. We propose here a quantitative comparison of these methods by using a surface FRET system with controlled amounts of donor and acceptor fluorophores and controlled distances between them. We support the system with a Monte Carlo simulation of FRET, which provides reference values for the FRET efficiency under various experimental conditions. We validate a representative set of FRET efficiencies and indices calculated from the different methods with different experimental settings. Finally, we test their sensitivity and draw conclusions for the preparation of FRET experiments in more complex and less-controlled systems.},

abstract = {The question of what role sex plays in evolution is still open despite decades of research. It has often been assumed that sex should facilitate the increase in fitness. Hence, the fact that it may break down highly favorable genetic combinations has been seen as a problem. Here, we consider an alternative approach. We define a measure that represents the ability of alleles to perform well across different combinations and, using numerical iterations within a classical population-genetic framework, show that selection in the presence of sex favors this ability in a highly robust manner. We also show that the mechanism responsible for this effect has been out of the purview of previous theory, because it operates during the evolutionary transient, and that the breaking down of favorable genetic combinations is an integral part of it. Implications of these results and more to evolutionary theory are discussed.},

Genetic evidence of population subdivision can be observed even when gene flow is very high, if the offspring distribution is skewed. A skewed offspring distribution arises when individuals can have very many offspring with some probability. This leads to high probability of identity by descent within subpopulations and results in genetic heterogeneity between subpopulations even when Nm is very large. Thus, we consider a limiting model in which the rates of coalescence and migration can be much higher than for a Wright-Fisher population. We derive the densities of pairwise coalescence times and expressions for F(ST) and other statistics under both the finite island model and a many-demes limit model. The results can explain the observed genetic heterogeneity among subpopulations of certain marine organisms despite substantial gene flow.},

title = {HIV Classification using Coalescent Theory},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Existing coalescent models and phylogenetic tools based on them are not designed for studying the genealogy of sequences like those of HIV since in HIV recombinants with multiple cross-over points between the parental strains frequently arise. Hence, ambiguous cases in the classification of HIV sequences into subtypes and Circulating Recombinant Forms (CRFs) have been treated with ad hoc methods in lack of tools based on a comprehensive coalescent model accounting for complex recombination patterns. RESULTS: We developed the program ARGUS that scores classifications of sequences into subtypes and recombinant forms. It reconstructs Ancestral Recombination Graphs (ARGs) that reflect the genealogy of the input sequences given a classification hypothesis. An ARG with maximal probability is approximated using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. ARGUS was able to distinguish the correct classification with a low error rate from plausible alternative classifications in simulation studies with realistic parameters. We applied our algorithm to decide between two recently debated alternatives in the classification of CRF02 of HIV-1 and find that CRF02 is indeed a recombinant of subtypes A and G. AVAILABILITY: ARGUS is implemented in C++ and the source code is available at http://gobics.de/software.

This work, in turn, has focused on the first step (substitution) during adaptive evolution. Here we extend this theory to allow multiple steps during adaptation. We find analytic solutions to the probability that adaptation follows a certain path during evolution as well as the probability that adaptation arrives at a given genotype regardless of the path taken. We also consider the probability of parallel adaptation and the proportion of the total increase in fitness caused by the first substitution.

It is a major challenge in biology to understand causes and consequences of the specific design of these networks. A characteristic design feature of metabolic networks is the presence of hub metabolites such as ATP or NADH that are involved in a high number of reactions. To study the emergence of hub metabolites, we implemented computer simulations of a widely accepted scenario for the evolution of metabolic networks. Our simulations indicate that metabolic networks with a large number of highly specialized enzymes may evolve from a few multifunctional enzymes. During this process, enzymes duplicate and specialize, leading to a loss of biochemical reactions and intermediary metabolites. Complex features of metabolic networks such as the presence of hubs may result from selection of growth rate if essential biochemical mechanisms are considered. Specifically, our simulations indicate that group transfer reactions are essential for the emergence of hubs.},

title = {Reverse transcriptase and protease sequence evolution in two HIV-1-infected couples},
abstract = {We analyzed the reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease sequences of HIV-1 isolates obtained over 7 years from two couples with known transmission histories. Phylogenetic trees constructed from the sequence data reflected the known transmission histories, despite the fact that the drug resistance mutations were most consistent with the drug treatment histories. However, the RT sequences from one couple diverged by 2.9% even before therapy was begun, and three (0.9%) of 339 unrelated individuals had viruses that shared a common ancestor with sequences from the recipient member of the couple but not with sequences from the transmitter. The divergence between the first two isolates from this couple is consistent with a pretransmission interval during which the transmitter developed a heterogeneous virus population. The closeness between the three controls and the recipient's first RT sequence may indicate slower evolution on the branches of the control sequences. Although the RT and protease genes contain phylogenetic information, they are suboptimal for reconstructing transmission history because the genetic distance between RT and protease isolates from unrelated individuals may occasionally approximate the distance between RT and protease isolates from related individuals.},

However, approaches based on the selection of individual sequences have not been entirely successful at the quantitative description of the distribution of structures and sequences in the protein universe because evolutionary pressure acts on the entire organism, rather than on a particular molecule. In parallel to this line of study, studies in population genetics and phenomenological molecular evolution established a mathematical framework to describe the changes in genome sequences in populations of organisms over time. Here, we review both microscopic (physics-based) and macroscopic (organism-level) models of protein-sequence evolution and demonstrate that bridging the two scales provides the most complete description of the protein universe starting from clearly defined, testable, and physiologically relevant assumptions.},

abstract = {Several recent theoretical studies of the genetics of adaptation have focused on the mutational landscape model, which considers evolution on rugged fitness landscapes (i.e., ones having many local optima). Adaptation in this model is characterized by several simple results. Here I ask whether these results also hold on correlated fitness landscapes, which are smoother than those considered in the mutational landscape model. In particular, I study the genetics of adaptation in the block model, a tunably rugged model of fitness landscapes. Considering the scenario in which adaptation begins from a high fitness wild-type DNA sequence, I use extreme value theory and computer simulations to study both single adaptive steps and entire adaptive walks. I show that all previous results characterizing single steps in adaptation in the mutational landscape model hold at least approximately on correlated landscapes in the block model; many entire-walk results, however, do not.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate sequence evolution in relation to different rates of disease progression in infants infected with HIV-1. DESIGN: Variability in the gp120 V3 region was analysed in HIV-1-infected children with different clinical courses, slow progression (n = 2) versus progressive disease (n = 3). METHODS: Cloning and sequencing of virus-derived DNA from uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells was performed at two to three timepoints from birth and up to the fifth year of life. Sequence variability was estimated by calculating the genetic distance and the proportion and ratio of synonymous and non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions over time. RESULTS: Genetic distances were significantly shorter in children with fast progression to disease, a predominance of synonymous nucleotide substitutions also being detected at later timepoints. Conversely, a preferential accumulation of non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions was apparent in children with slow disease progression. Furthermore, a positive correlation between a decreased ratio of synonymous/non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions and the ability of children's sera to react with synthetic peptides representing the autologous virus sequence was determined. CONCLUSION: Data suggest that an antigenically more diverse virus population emerges in infected children with slower progression to disease as a result of a stronger immune pressure.},

abstract = {We use traveling-wave theory to derive expressions for the rate of accumulation of deleterious mutations under Muller's ratchet and the speed of adaptation under positive selection in asexual populations. Traveling-wave theory is a semi-deterministic description of an evolving population, where the bulk of the population is modeled using deterministic equations, but the class of the highest-fitness genotypes, whose evolution over time determines loss or gain of fitness in the population, is given proper stochastic treatment. We derive improved methods to model the highest-fitness class (the stochastic edge) for both Muller's ratchet and adaptive evolution, and calculate analytic correction terms that compensate for inaccuracies which arise when treating discrete fitness classes as a continuum. We show that traveling-wave theory makes excellent predictions for the rate of mutation accumulation in the case of Muller's ratchet, and makes good predictions for the speed of adaptation in a very broad parameter range. We predict the adaptation rate to grow logarithmically in the population size until the population size is extremely large.},

abstract = {Human influenza A (subtype H3N2) is characterized genetically by the limited standing diversity of its hemagglutinin and antigenically by clusters that emerge and replace each other within 2 to 8 years. By introducing an epidemiological model that allows for differences between the genetic and antigenic properties of the virus's hemagglutinin, we show that these patterns can arise from cluster-specific immunity alone. Central to the formulation is a genotype-to-phenotype mapping, based on neutral networks, with antigenic phenotypes, not genotypes, determining the degree of strain cross-immunity. The model parsimoniously explains well-known, as well as previously unremarked, features of interpandemic influenza dynamics and evolution. It captures the observed boom-and-bust pattern of viral evolution, with periods of antigenic stasis during which genetic diversity grows, and with episodic contraction of this diversity during cluster transitions.},

We identified 27 regions of the genome with one or more sequence variants showing significant association with height. The estimated effects per allele of these variants ranged between 0.3 and 0.6 cm and, taken together, they explain around 3.7% of the population variation in height. The genes neighboring the identified loci cluster in biological processes related to skeletal development and mitosis. Association to three previously reported loci are replicated in our analyses, and the strongest association was with SNPs in the ZBTB38 gene.},

title = {Adaptations to fluctuating selection in Drosophila},
abstract = {Time-dependent selection causes the adaptive evolution of new phenotypes, and this dynamics can be traced in genomic data. We have analyzed polymorphisms and substitutions in Drosophila, using a more sensitive inference method for adaptations than the standard population-genetic tests. We find evidence that selection itself is strongly time-dependent, with changes occurring at nearly the rate of neutral evolution. At the same time, higher than previously estimated levels of selection make adaptive responses by a factor 10-100 faster than the pace of selection changes, ensuring that adaptations are an efficient mode of evolution under time-dependent selection. The rate of selection changes is faster in noncoding DNA, i.e., the inference of functional elements can less be based on sequence conservation than for proteins. Our results suggest that selection acts not only as a constraint but as a major driving force of genomic change.},

title = {The effects of molecular noise and size control on variability in the budding yeast cell cycle},
abstract = {Molecular noise in gene expression can generate substantial variability in protein concentration. However, its effect on the precision of a natural eukaryotic circuit such as the control of cell cycle remains unclear. We use single-cell imaging of fluorescently labelled budding yeast to measure times from division to budding (G1) and from budding to the next division. The variability in G1 decreases with the square root of the ploidy through a 1N/2N/4N ploidy series, consistent with simple stochastic models for molecular noise. Also, increasing the gene dosage of G1 cyclins decreases the variability in G1. A new single-cell reporter for cell protein content allows us to determine the contribution to temporal G1 variability of deterministic size control (that is, smaller cells extending G1). Cell size control contributes significantly to G1 variability in daughter cells but not in mother cells. However, even in daughters, size-independent noise is the largest quantitative contributor to G1 variability. Exit of the transcriptional repressor Whi5 from the nucleus partitions G1 into two temporally uncorrelated and functionally distinct steps. The first step, which depends on the G1 cyclin gene CLN3, corresponds to noisy size control that extends G1 in small daughters, but is of negligible duration in mothers. The second step, whose variability decreases with increasing CLN2 gene dosage, is similar in mothers and daughters. This analysis decomposes the regulatory dynamics of the Start transition into two independent modules, a size sensing module and a timing module, each of which is predominantly controlled by a different G1 cyclin.},

abstract = {Experimental confirmation of Wright's shifting balance theory of evolution, one of the most comprehensive theories of adaptive evolution, is presented. The theory is regarded by many as a cornerstone of modern evolutionary thought, but there has been little direct empirical evidence supporting it. Some of its underlying assumptions are viewed as contradictory, and the existence and efficacy of the theory's fundamental adaptive process, interdemic selection, is the focus of controversy. Interdemic selection was imposed on large arrays of laboratory populations of the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum in the manner described by Wright: the differential dispersion of individuals from demes of high fitness into demes of low fitness. A significant increase in average fitness was observed in the experimental arrays when compared to control populations with equivalent but random migration rates. The response was not proportional to the selection differential: The largest response occurred with interdemic selection every two generations rather than every generation or every three generations. The results indicate that the interdemic phase of Wright's shifting balance theory can increase average fitness and suggest that gene interactions are involved in the observed response.},

The coding exons of ten expressed genes were found to be commonly deleted, including multiple genes with roles in sex steroid metabolism, olfaction and drug response. These common deletion polymorphisms typically represent ancestral mutations that are in linkage disequilibrium with nearby SNPs, meaning that their association to disease can often be evaluated in the course of SNP-based whole-genome association studies.},

abstract = {Several codon-based models for the evolution of protein-coding DNA sequences are developed that account for varying selection intensity among amino acid sites. The "neutral model" assumes two categories of sites at which amino acid replacements are either neutral or deleterious. The "positive-selection model" assumes an additional category of positively selected sites at which nonsynonymous substitutions occur at a higher rate than synonymous ones. This model is also used to identify target sites for positive selection. The models are applied to a data set of the V3 region of the HIV-1 envelope gene, sequenced at different years after the infection of one patient. The results provide strong support for variable selection intensity among amino acid sites The neutral model is rejected in favor of the positive-selection model, indicating the operation of positive selection in the region. Positively selected sites are found in both the V3 region and the flanking regions.},

title = {The fixation probability of rare mutators in finite asexual populations},
abstract = { A mutator is an allele that increases the mutation rate throughout the genome by disrupting some aspect of DNA replication or repair. Mutators that increase the mutation rate by the order of 100 fold have been observed to spontaneously emerge and achieve high frequencies in natural populations and in long-term laboratory evolution experiments with \textit{E. coli}. In principle, the fixation of mutator alleles is limited by (i) competition with mutations in wild-type backgrounds, (ii) additional deleterious mutational load, and (iii) random genetic drift. Using a multiple locus model and employing both simulation and analytic methods, we investigate the effects of these three factors on the fixation probability {\$}P_{fix}{\$} of an initially rare mutator as a function of population size {\$}N{\$}, beneficial and deleterious mutation rates, and the strength of mutations {\$}s{\$}. Our diffusion based approximation for {\$}P_{fix}{\$} successfully captures effects (ii) and (iii) when selection is fast compared to mutation ({\$}\mu/s \ll 1{\$}). This enables us to predict the conditions under which mutators will be evolutionarily favored. Surprisingly, our simulations show that effect (i) is typically small for strong-effect mutators. Our results agree semi-quantitatively with existing laboratory evolution experiments and suggest future experimental directions. },

We have discovered a globally distributed incompatibility in the primarily selfing species Caenorhabditis elegans that has been maintained despite its negative consequences for fitness. Embryos homozygous for a naturally occurring deletion of the zygotically acting gene zeel-1 arrest if their sperm parent carries an incompatible allele of a second, paternal-effect locus, peel-1. The two interacting loci are tightly linked, with incompatible alleles occurring in linkage disequilibrium in two common haplotypes. These haplotypes exhibit elevated sequence divergence, and population genetic analyses of this region indicate that natural selection is preserving both haplotypes in the population. Our data suggest that long-term maintenance of a balanced polymorphism has permitted the incompatibility to persist despite gene flow across the rest of the genome.},

abstract = {Drug resistance is a major problem in the treatment of AIDS, due to the very high mutation rate of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and subsequent rapid development of resistance to new drugs. Identification of mutations associated with drug resistance is critical for both individualized treatment selection and new drug design. We have performed an automated mutation analysis of HIV Type 1 (HIV-1) protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) from approximately 40,000 AIDS patient plasma samples sequenced by Specialty Laboratories Inc. from 1999 to mid-2002. This data set provides a nearly complete mutagenesis of HIV protease and enables the calculation of statistically significant K(a)/K(s) values for each individual amino acid mutation in protease and RT. Positive selection (i.e., a K(a)/K(s) ratio of >1, indicating increased reproductive fitness) detected 19 of 23 known drug-resistant mutation positions in protease and 20 of 34 such positions in RT. We also discovered 163 new amino acid mutations in HIV protease and RT that are strong candidates for drug resistance or fitness. Our results match available independent data on protease mutations associated with specific drug treatments and mutations with positive reproductive fitness, with high statistical significance (the P values for the observed matches to occur by random chance are 10(-5.2) and 10(-16.6), respectively). Our mutation analysis provides a valuable resource for AIDS research and will be available to academic researchers upon publication at http://www.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/HIV. Our data indicate that positive selection mapping is an analysis that can yield powerful insights from high-throughput sequencing of rapidly mutating pathogens.},

In all three continental groups we find widespread signals of recent positive selection. Most signals are region-specific, though a significant excess are shared across groups. Contrary to some earlier low resolution studies that suggested a paucity of recent selection in sub-Saharan Africans, we find that by some measures our strongest signals of selection are from the Yoruba population. Finally, since these signals indicate the existence of genetic variants that have substantially different fitnesses, they must indicate loci that are the source of significant phenotypic variation. Though the relevant phenotypes are generally not known, such loci should be of particular interest in mapping studies of complex traits. For this purpose we have developed a set of SNPs that can be used to tag the strongest approximately 250 signals of recent selection in each population.},

abstract = {Identifying regions of the Drosophila melanogaster genome that have been recent targets of positive Darwinian selection will provide evidence for adaptations that have helped this species to colonize temperate habitats. We have begun a search for such genomic regions by analyzing multiple loci (about 250) dispersed across the X chromosome in a putatively ancestral population from East Africa and a derived European population. For both populations we found evidence for past changes in population size. We estimated that a major bottleneck associated with the colonization of Europe occurred about 3,500-16,000 years ago. We also found that while this bottleneck can account for most of the reduction in variation observed in the European sample, there is a deficit of polymorphism in some genomic regions that cannot be explained by demography alone.},

A high mutation rate was initially beneficial because it allowed faster adaptation, but this benefit disappeared once adaptation was achieved. Mutator bacteria accumulated mutations that, although neutral in the mouse gut, are often deleterious in secondary environments. Consistently, the competitiveness of mutator bacteria is reduced during transmission to and re-colonization of similar hosts. The short-term advantages and long-term disadvantages of mutator bacteria could account for their frequency in nature.},

abstract = {Some statistical properties of samples of DNA sequences are studied under an infinite-site neutral model with recombination. The two quantities of interest are R, the number of recombination events in the history of a sample of sequences, and RM, the number of recombination events that can be parsimoniously inferred from a sample of sequences. Formulas are derived for the mean and variance of R. In contrast to R, RM can be determined from the sample. Since no formulas are known for the mean and variance of RM, they are estimated with Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that RM is often much less than R, therefore, the number of recombination events may be greatly under-estimated in a parsimonious reconstruction of the history of a sample. The statistic RM can be used to estimate the product of the recombination rate and the population size or, if the recombination rate is known, to estimate the population size. To illustrate this, DNA sequences from the Adh region of Drosophila melanogaster are used to estimate the effective population size of this species.},

abstract = {Sexual reproduction shuffles genetic variation, potentially enhancing the evolutionary response to environmental change. Many asexual organisms respond to stress by generating facultative sexual reproduction, presumably as a means of escaping the trap of low genetic diversity. Self-fertilizing organisms are subject to similar genetic limitations: the consistent loss of genetic diversity within lineages restricts the production of variation through recombination. Selfing organisms may therefore benefit from a similar shift in mating strategy during periods of stress. We determined the effects of environmental stress via starvation and passage through the stress-resistant dauer stage on mating system dynamics of Caenorhabditis elegans, which reproduces predominantly through self-fertilization but is capable of outcrossing in the presence of males. Starvation elevated male frequencies in a strain-specific manner through differential male survival during dauer exposure and increased outcrossing rates after dauer exposure. In the most responsive strain, the mating system changed from predominantly selfing to almost exclusively outcrossing. Like facultative sex in asexual organisms, facultative outcrossing in C. elegans may periodically facilitate adaptation under stress. Such a shift in reproductive strategy should have a major impact on evolutionary change within these populations and may be a previously unrecognized feature of other highly selfing organisms.},

title = {A study of the coevolutionary patterns operating within the env gene of the HIV-1 group M subtypes},
abstract = {The env gene of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a functionally important gene responsible for the production of protein products (gp120 and gp41) involved in host cell recognition, binding, and entry. This occurs through a complex and, as yet, not fully understood process of protein-protein interaction and within and between protein functional communication. Exposure on the surface of active HIV virions means the gp120-gp41 complexes are subjected to intense immune system pressure and have, therefore, evolved mechanisms to avoid neutralization. Using protein-coding sequences representing all the HIV type-1 (HIV-1) group M subtypes, we have identified amino acids within the env gene whose evolution is inextricably linked over the entire HIV-1 group M epidemic. We identified 848 pairs of coevolving residues (involving 263 out of 764 amino acid sites), which represent 0.29% of all possible pairs. Of the coevolving pairs, 68% were significantly correlated by hydrophobicity, molecular weight, or both hydrophobicity and molecular weight. Subsequent grouping of coevolving pairs resulted in the identification of 290 groups of amino acid residues, with the size of these groups ranging from 2 to 10 amino acid residues. Many of these dependencies are correlated by function including CD4 binding, coreceptor binding, glycosylation, and protein-protein interaction. This analysis provides important information regarding the functional dependencies observed within all the HIV-1 group M subtypes and may assist in the identification of functional protein domains and therapeutic targets within the HIV-1 env gene.},

title = {Connecting protein structure with predictions of regulatory sites},
abstract = {A common task posed by microarray experiments is to infer the binding site preferences for a known transcription factor from a collection of genes that it regulates and to ascertain whether the factor acts alone or in a complex. The converse problem can also be posed: Given a collection of binding sites, can the regulatory factor or complex of factors be inferred? Both tasks are substantially facilitated by using relatively simple homology models for protein-DNA interactions, as well as the rapidly expanding protein structure database. For budding yeast, we are able to construct reliable structural models for 67 transcription factors and with them redetermine factor binding sites by using a Bayesian Gibbs sampling algorithm and an extensive protein localization data set. For 49 factors in common with a prior analysis of this data set (based largely on phylogenetic conservation), we find that half of the previously predicted binding motifs are in need of some revision. We also solve the inverse problem of ascertaining the factors from the binding sites by assigning a correct protein fold to 25 of the 49 cases from a previous study. Our approach is easily extended to other organisms, including higher eukaryotes. Our study highlights the utility of enlarging current structural genomics projects that exhaustively sample fold structure space to include all factors with significantly different DNA-binding specificities.},

title = {Predicting the evolution of sex on complex fitness landscapes},
abstract = {Most population genetic theories on the evolution of sex or recombination are based on fairly restrictive assumptions about the nature of the underlying fitness landscapes. Here we use computer simulations to study the evolution of sex on fitness landscapes with different degrees of complexity and epistasis. We evaluate predictors of the evolution of sex, which are derived from the conditions established in the population genetic literature for the evolution of sex on simpler fitness landscapes. These predictors are based on quantities such as the variance of Hamming distance, mean fitness, additive genetic variance, and epistasis. We show that for complex fitness landscapes all the predictors generally perform poorly. Interestingly, while the simplest predictor, Delta Var(HD), also suffers from a lack of accuracy, it turns out to be the most robust across different types of fitness landscapes. Delta Var(HD) is based on the change in Hamming distance variance induced by recombination and thus does not require individual fitness measurements. The presence of loci that are not under selection can, however, severely diminish predictor accuracy. Our study thus highlights the difficulty of establishing reliable criteria for the evolution of sex on complex fitness landscapes and illustrates the challenge for both theoretical and experimental research on the origin and maintenance of sexual reproduction.},

title = {Timing the emergence of resistance to anti-HIV drugs with large genetic barriers},
abstract = {New antiretroviral drugs that offer large genetic barriers to resistance, such as the recently approved inhibitors of HIV-1 protease, tipranavir and darunavir, present promising weapons to avert the failure of current therapies for HIV infection. Optimal treatment strategies with the new drugs, however, are yet to be established. A key limitation is the poor understanding of the process by which HIV surmounts large genetic barriers to resistance. Extant models of HIV dynamics are predicated on the predominance of deterministic forces underlying the emergence of resistant genomes. In contrast, stochastic forces may dominate, especially when the genetic barrier is large, and delay the emergence of resistant genomes. We develop a mathematical model of HIV dynamics under the influence of an antiretroviral drug to predict the waiting time for the emergence of genomes that carry the requisite mutations to overcome the genetic barrier of the drug. We apply our model to describe the development of resistance to tipranavir in in vitro serial passage experiments. Model predictions of the times of emergence of different mutant genomes with increasing resistance to tipranavir are in quantitative agreement with experiments, indicating that our model captures the dynamics of the development of resistance to antiretroviral drugs accurately. Further, model predictions provide insights into the influence of underlying evolutionary processes such as recombination on the development of resistance, and suggest guidelines for drug design: drugs that offer large genetic barriers to resistance with resistance sites tightly localized on the viral genome and exhibiting positive epistatic interactions maximally inhibit the emergence of resistant genomes.},

title = {On the application of statistical physics to evolutionary biology},
abstract = {There is a close analogy between statistical thermodynamics and the evolution of allele frequencies under mutation, selection and random drift. Wright's formula for the stationary distribution of allele frequencies is analogous to the Boltzmann distribution in statistical physics. Population size, 2N, plays the role of the inverse temperature, 1/kT, and determines the magnitude of random fluctuations. Log mean fitness, log(W), tends to increase under selection, and is analogous to a (negative) energy; a potential function, U, increases under mutation in a similar way. An entropy, S(H), can be defined which measures the deviation from the distribution of allele frequencies expected under random drift alone; the sum G=E[log(W)+U+S(H)] gives a free fitness that increases as the population evolves towards its stationary distribution. Usually, we observe the distribution of a few quantitative traits that depend on the frequencies of very many alleles. The mean and variance of such traits are analogous to observable quantities in statistical thermodynamics. Thus, we can define an entropy, S(Omega), which measures the volume of allele frequency space that is consistent with the observed trait distribution. The stationary distribution of the traits is exp[2N(log(W)+U+S(Omega))]; this applies with arbitrary epistasis and dominance. The entropies S(Omega), S(H) are distinct, but converge when there are so many alleles that traits fluctuate close to their expectations. Populations tend to evolve towards states that can be realised in many ways (i.e., large S(Omega)), which may lead to a substantial drop below the adaptive peak; we illustrate this point with a simple model of genetic redundancy. This analogy with statistical thermodynamics brings together previous ideas in a general framework, and justifies a maximum entropy approximation to the dynamics of quantitative traits.},

title = {Bursts of nonsynonymous substitutions in HIV-1 evolution reveal instances of positive selection at conservative protein sites},
abstract = {The fixation of a new allele can be driven by Darwinian positive selection or can be due to random genetic drift. Identifying instances of positive selection is a difficult task, because its impact is routinely obscured by the action of negative selection. The nature of the genetic code dictates that positive selection in favor of an amino acid replacement should often cause a burst of two or three nucleotide substitutions at a single codon site, because a large fraction of amino acid replacements cannot be achieved after just one nucleotide substitution. Here, we study pairs of successive nonsynonymous substitutions at one codon in the course of evolution of HIV-1 genes within HIV-1 populations inhabiting infected individuals. Such pairs are more numerous and more clumped than expected if different substitutions were independent and than what is observed for pairs of successive synonymous substitutions. Bursts of nonsynonymous substitutions in HIV-1 evolution cannot be explained by mutational biases and must, therefore, be due to positive selection. Both reversals, exact or imprecise, of fixed deleterious mutations and acquisitions of amino acids with new properties are responsible for the bursts. Temporal clumping is strongest at codon sites with a low overall rate of nonsynonymous evolution, implying that a substantial fraction of replacements of conservative amino acids are driven by positive selection. We identified many conservative sites of HIV-1 proteins that occasionally experience positive selection.},

title = {Probability of fixation in a heterogeneous environment},
abstract = {We investigate the probability of fixation of a new mutation arising in a metapopulation that ranges over a heterogeneous selective environment. Using simulations, we test the performance of several approximations of this probability, including a new analytical approximation based on separation of the timescales of selection and migration. We extend all approximations to multideme metapopulations with arbitrary population structure. Our simulations show that no single approximation produces accurate predictions of fixation probabilities for all cases of potential interest. At the limits of low and high migration, previously published approximations are found to be highly accurate. The new separation-of-timescales approach provides the best approximations for intermediate rates of migration among habitats, provided selection is not too intense. For nonzero migration and relatively strong selection, all approximations perform poorly. However, the probability of fixation is bounded above and below by the approximations based on low and high migration limits. Surprisingly, in our simulations with symmetric migration, heterogeneous selection in a metapopulation never decreased-and sometimes substantially increased-the probability of fixation of a new allele compared to metapopulations experiencing homogeneous selection with the same mean selection intensity.},

title = {Mapping sites of positive selection and amino acid diversification in the HIV genome: an alternative approach to vaccine design?},
abstract = {A safe and effective HIV-1 vaccine is urgently needed to control the worldwide AIDS epidemic. Traditional methods of vaccine development have been frustratingly slow, and it is becoming increasingly apparent that radical new approaches may be required. Computational and mathematical approaches, combined with evolutionary reasoning, may provide new insights for the design of an efficacious AIDS vaccine. Here, we used codon-based substitution models and maximum-likelihood (ML) methods to identify positively selected sites that are likely to be involved in the immune control of HIV-1. Analysis of subtypes B and C revealed widespread adaptive evolution. Positively selected amino acids were detected in all nine HIV-1 proteins, including Env. Of particular interest was the high level of positive selection within the C-terminal regions of the immediate-early regulatory proteins, Tat and Rev. Many of the amino acid replacements were associated with the emergence of novel (or alternative) myristylation and casein kinase II (CKII) phosphorylation sites. The impact of these changes on the conformation and antigenicity of Tat and Rev remains to be established. In rhesus macaques, a single CTL-associated amino substitution in Tat has been linked to escape from acute SIV infection. Understanding the relationship between host-driven positive selection and antigenic variation may lead to the development of novel vaccine strategies that preempt the escape process.},

title = {The speed of evolution and maintenance of variation in asexual populations},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The rate at which beneficial mutations accumulate determines how fast asexual populations evolve, but this is only partially understood. Some recent clonal-interference models suggest that evolution in large asexual populations is limited because smaller beneficial mutations are outcompeted by larger beneficial mutations that occur in different lineages within the same population. This analysis assumes that the important mutations fix one at a time; it ignores multiple beneficial mutations that occur in the lineage of an earlier beneficial mutation, before the first mutation in the series can fix. We focus on the effects of such multiple mutations. RESULTS: Our analysis predicts that the variation in fitness maintained by a continuously evolving population increases as the logarithm of the population size and logarithm of the mutation rate and thus yields a similar logarithmic increase in the speed of evolution. To test these predictions, we evolved asexual budding yeast in glucose-limited media at a range of population sizes and mutation rates. CONCLUSIONS: We find that their evolution is dominated by the accumulation of multiple mutations of moderate effect. Our results agree with our theoretical predictions and are inconsistent with the one-by-one fixation of mutants assumed by recent clonal-interference analysis.},

A principal limitation for fundamental biochemical studies of these modular megasynthases, as well as for their applications in biotechnology, is the challenge associated with manipulating the natural microorganism that produces a polyketide of interest. To ameliorate this limitation, over the past decade several genetically amenable microbes have been developed as heterologous hosts for polyketide biosynthesis. Here we review the state of the art as well as the difficulties associated with heterologous polyketide production. In particular, we focus on two model hosts, Streptomyces coelicolor and Escherichia coli. Future directions for this relatively new but growing technological opportunity are also discussed.},

abstract = {RNA virus genomes are compact, often containing multiple overlapping reading frames and functional secondary structure. Consequently, it is thought that evolutionary interactions between nucleotide sites are commonplace in the genomes of these infectious agents. However, the role of epistasis in natural populations of RNA viruses remains unclear. To investigate the pervasiveness of epistasis in RNA viruses, we used a parsimony-based computational method to identify pairs of co-occurring mutations along phylogenies of 177 RNA virus genes. This analysis revealed widespread evidence for positive epistatic interactions at both synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide sites and in both clonal and recombining viruses, with the majority of these interactions spanning very short sequence regions. These findings have important implications for understanding the key aspects of RNA virus evolution, including the dynamics of adaptation. Additionally, many comparative analyses that utilize the phylogenetic relationships among gene sequences assume that mutations represent independent, uncorrelated events. Our results show that this assumption may often be invalid.},

title = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 recombination: rate, fidelity, and putative hot spots},
abstract = {Previously, we reported that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) recombines approximately two to three times per genome per replication cycle, an extremely high rate of recombination given the relatively small genome size of HIV-1. However, a recombination hot spot involving sequence of nonretroviral origin was identified in the vector system utilized, raising the possibility that this hot spot skewed the rate of recombination, and the rate of recombination observed was an overestimation. To address this issue, an HIV-1-derived vector system was used to examine the rate of recombination between autologous HIV-1 sequences after restricting replication to a single cycle in the absence of this hot spot. Viral DNA and RNA were analyzed by a combination of the heteroduplex tracking assay, restriction enzyme analysis, DNA sequencing, and reverse transcription-PCR. The results indicate that HIV-1 undergoes recombination at a minimum rate of 2.8 crossovers per genome per cycle. Again, this is a very high rate given the small size of the HIV-1 genome. The results also suggested that there might be local hot spots of recombination at different locations throughout the genome since 13 of the 33 strand transfers identified by DNA sequencing shared the same site of recombination with one or two other clones. Furthermore, identification of crossover segments also allowed examination of mutations at the point of recombination, since it has been predicted from some studies of cell-free systems that mutations may occur with a frequency of 30 to 50% at crossover junctions. However, DNA sequence analysis of crossover junctions indicated that homologous recombination during viral replication was not particularly mutagenic, indicating that there are other factors or conditions not yet reproduced in cell-free systems which contribute to fidelity during retroviral recombination.},

abstract = {Naturally occurring sequence variation that affects gene expression is an important source of phenotypic differences among individuals within a species. We and others have previously shown that such regulatory variation can occur both at the same locus as the gene whose expression it affects (local regulatory variation) and elsewhere in the genome at trans-acting factors. Here we present a detailed analysis of genome-wide local regulatory variation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We used genetic linkage analysis to show that nearly a quarter of all yeast genes contain local regulatory variation between two divergent strains. We measured allele-specific expression in a diploid hybrid of the two strains for 77 genes showing strong self-linkage and found that in 52%-78% of these genes, local regulatory variation acts directly in cis. We also experimentally confirmed one example in which local regulatory variation in the gene AMN1 acts in trans through a feedback loop. Genome-wide sequence analysis revealed that genes subject to local regulatory variation show increased polymorphism in the promoter regions, and that some but not all of this increase is due to polymorphisms in predicted transcription factor binding sites. Increased polymorphism was also found in the 3' untranslated regions of these genes. These findings point to the importance of cis-acting variation, but also suggest that there is a diverse set of mechanisms through which local variation can affect gene expression levels.},

abstract = {Domesticated Asian rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the oldest domesticated crop species in the world, having fed more people than any other plant in human history. We report the patterns of DNA sequence variation in rice and its wild ancestor, O. rufipogon, across 111 randomly chosen gene fragments, and use these to infer the evolutionary dynamics that led to the origins of rice. There is a genome-wide excess of high-frequency derived single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in O. sativa varieties, a pattern that has not been reported for other crop species. We developed several alternative models to explain contemporary patterns of polymorphisms in rice, including a (i) selectively neutral population bottleneck model, (ii) bottleneck plus migration model, (iii) multiple selective sweeps model, and (iv) bottleneck plus selective sweeps model. We find that a simple bottleneck model, which has been the dominant demographic model for domesticated species, cannot explain the derived nucleotide polymorphism site frequency spectrum in rice. Instead, a bottleneck model that incorporates selective sweeps, or a more complex demographic model that includes subdivision and gene flow, are more plausible explanations for patterns of variation in domesticated rice varieties. If selective sweeps are indeed the explanation for the observed nucleotide data of domesticated rice, it suggests that strong selection can leave its imprint on genome-wide polymorphism patterns, contrary to expectations that selection results only in a local signature of variation.},

title = {Computing the number of metastable states in infinite-range models},
abstract = { In these notes I will review the results that have been obtained in these last years on the computation of the number of metastable states in infinite-range models of disordered systems. This is a particular case of the problem of computing the exponentially large number of stationary points of a random function. Quite surprisingly supersymmetry plays a crucial role in this problem. A careful analysis of the physical implication of supersymmetry and of supersymmetry breaking will be presented: the most spectacular one is that in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model for spin glasses most of the stationary points are saddles, as predicted long time ago. },

abstract = {To study the permanency of response to selection for a quantitative character in finite populations and the nature of the genetic effects that contribute to this response, we have used the covariance between ancestors and descendents within populations. Effects and variances are defined for an initial equilibrium random mating monoecious population that gives rise to replicate finite populations. After a prescribed history of restricted population size, the replicate populations are expanded, and the covariance between ancestors and descendents is quantified in terms of descent measures and genetic components in the initial population as a means of determining the additive variance within populations. Several dominance components including joint dominance effects of loci contribute to the additive variance, some of which can be negative. There is always a positive contribution of additive by additive variance to the additive variance within populations, which can be large. With the new definitions of components of genetic variance within populations, selection response is formulated in the same manner as for the initial random mating population, but the components have been modified considerably by the restricted population size.},

title = {Natural selection and the frequency distributions of "silent" DNA polymorphism in Drosophila},
abstract = {In Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Drosophila melanogaster, codon bias may be maintained by a balance among mutation pressure, genetic drift, and natural selection favoring translationally superior codons. Under such an evolutionary model, silent mutations fall into two fitness categories: preferred mutations that increase codon bias and unpreferred changes in the opposite direction. This prediction can be tested by comparing the frequency spectra of synonymous changes segregating within populations; natural selection will elevate the frequencies of advantageous mutations relative to that of deleterious changes. The frequency distributions of preferred and unpreferred mutations differ in the predicted direction among 99 alleles of two D. pseudoobscura genes and five alleles of eight D. simulans genes. This result confirms the existence of fitness classes of silent mutations. Maximum likelihood estimates suggest that selection intensity at silent sites is, on average, very weak in both D. pseudoobscura and D. simulans (magnitude of NS approximately 1). Inference of evolutionary processes from within-species sequence variation is often hindered by the assumption of a stationary frequency distribution. This assumption can be avoided when identifying the action of selection and tested when estimating selection intensity.},

title = {Statistical mechanics and the evolution of polygenic quantitative traits},
abstract = {The evolution of quantitative characters depends on the frequencies of the alleles involved, yet these frequencies cannot usually be measured. Previous groups have proposed an approximation to the dynamics of quantitative traits, based on an analogy with statistical mechanics. We present a modified version of that approach, which makes the analogy more precise and applies quite generally to describe the evolution of allele frequencies. We calculate explicitly how the macroscopic quantities (i.e., quantities that depend on the quantitative trait) depend on evolutionary forces, in a way that is independent of the microscopic details. We first show that the stationary distribution of allele frequencies under drift, selection, and mutation maximizes a certain measure of entropy, subject to constraints on the expectation of observable quantities. We then approximate the dynamical changes in these expectations, assuming that the distribution of allele frequencies always maximizes entropy, conditional on the expected values. When applied to directional selection on an additive trait, this gives a very good approximation to the evolution of the trait mean and the genetic variance, when the number of mutations per generation is sufficiently high (4Nmicro > 1). We show how the method can be modified for small mutation rates (4Nmicro --> 0). We outline how this method describes epistatic interactions as, for example, with stabilizing selection.},

title = {The signature of positive selection on standing genetic variation},
abstract = {Considerable interest is focused on the use of polymorphism data to identify regions of the genome that underlie recent adaptations. These searches are guided by a simple model of positive selection, in which a mutation is favored as soon as it arises. This assumption may not be realistic, as environmental changes and range expansions may lead previously neutral or deleterious alleles to become beneficial. We examine what effect this mode of selection has on patterns of variation at linked neutral sites by implementing a new coalescent model of positive directional selection on standing variation. In this model, a neutral allele arises and drifts in the population, then at frequency f becomes beneficial, and eventually reaches fixation. Depending on the value of f, this scenario can lead to a large variance in allele frequency spectra and in levels of linkage disequilibrium at linked, neutral sites. In particular, for intermediate f, the beneficial substitution often leads to a loss of rare alleles--a pattern that differs markedly from the signature of directional selection currently relied on by researchers. These findings highlight the importance of an accurate characterization of the effects of positive selection, if we are to reliably identify recent adaptations from polymorphism data.},

title = {Selection for recombination in structured populations},
abstract = {In finite populations, linkage disequilibria generated by the interaction of drift and directional selection (Hill-Robertson effect) can select for sex and recombination, even in the absence of epistasis. Previous models of this process predict very little advantage to recombination in large panmictic populations. In this article we demonstrate that substantial levels of linkage disequilibria can accumulate by drift in the presence of selection in populations of any size, provided that the population is subdivided. We quantify (i) the linkage disequilibrium produced by the interaction of drift and selection during the selective sweep of beneficial alleles at two loci in a subdivided population and (ii) the selection for recombination generated by these disequilibria. We show that, in a population subdivided into n demes of large size N, both the disequilibrium and the selection for recombination are equivalent to that expected in a single population of a size intermediate between the size of each deme (N) and the total size (nN), depending on the rate of migration among demes, m. We also show by simulations that, with small demes, the selection for recombination is stronger than both that expected in an unstructured population (m = 1 - 1/n) and that expected in a set of isolated demes (m = 0). Indeed, migration maintains polymorphisms that would otherwise be lost rapidly from small demes, while population structure maintains enough local stochasticity to generate linkage disequilibria. These effects are also strong enough to overcome the twofold cost of sex under strong selection when sex is initially rare. Overall, our results show that the stochastic theories of the evolution of sex apply to a much broader range of conditions than previously expected.},

title = {Toward a comprehensive atlas of the physical interactome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae},
abstract = {Defining protein complexes is critical to virtually all aspects of cell biology. Two recent affinity purification/mass spectrometry studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have vastly increased the available protein interaction data. The practical utility of such high throughput interaction sets, however, is substantially decreased by the presence of false positives. Here we created a novel probabilistic metric that takes advantage of the high density of these data, including both the presence and absence of individual associations, to provide a measure of the relative confidence of each potential protein-protein interaction. This analysis largely overcomes the noise inherent in high throughput immunoprecipitation experiments. For example, of the 12,122 binary interactions in the general repository of interaction data (BioGRID) derived from these two studies, we marked 7504 as being of substantially lower confidence. Additionally, applying our metric and a stringent cutoff we identified a set of 9074 interactions (including 4456 that were not among the 12,122 interactions) with accuracy comparable to that of conventional small scale methodologies. Finally we organized proteins into coherent multisubunit complexes using hierarchical clustering. This work thus provides a highly accurate physical interaction map of yeast in a format that is readily accessible to the biological community.},

title = {The hitchhiking effect on the site frequency spectrum of {DNA} polymorphisms},
abstract = {The level of DNA sequence variation is reduced in regions of the Drosophila melanogaster genome where the rate of crossing over per physical distance is also reduced. This observation has been interpreted as support for the simple model of genetic hitchhiking, in which directional selection on rare variants, e.g., newly arising advantageous mutants, sweeps linked neutral alleles to fixation, thus eliminating polymorphisms near the selected site. However, the frequency spectra of segregating sites of several loci from some populations exhibiting reduced levels of nucleotide diversity and reduced numbers of segregating sites did not appear different from what would be expected under a neutral equilibrium model. Specifically, a skew toward an excess of rare sites was not observed in these samples, as measured by Tajima's D. Because this skew was predicted by a simple hitchhiking model, yet it had never been expressed quantitatively and compared directly to DNA polymorphism data, this paper investigates the hitchhiking effect on the site frequency spectrum, as measured by Tajima's D and several other statistics, using a computer simulation model based on the coalescent process and recurrent hitchhiking events. The results presented here demonstrate that under the simple hitchhiking model (1) the expected value of Tajima's D is large and negative (indicating a skew toward rare variants), (2) that Tajima's test has reasonable power to detect a skew in the frequency spectrum for parameters comparable to those from actual data sets, and (3) that the Tajima's Ds observed in several data sets are very unlikely to have been the result of simple hitchhiking. Consequently, the simple hitchhiking model is not a sufficient explanation for the DNA polymorphism at those loci exhibiting a decreased number of segregating sites yet not exhibiting a skew in the frequency spectrum.},

title = {Recombination increases human immunodeficiency virus fitness, but not necessarily diversity},
abstract = {Recombination can facilitate the accumulation of mutations and accelerate the emergence of resistance to current antiretroviral therapies for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Yet, since recombination can also dissociate favourable combinations of mutations, the benefit of recombination to HIV remains in question. The confounding effects of mutation, multiple infections of cells, random genetic drift and fitness selection that underlie HIV evolution render the influence of recombination difficult to unravel. We developed computer simulations that mimic the genomic diversification of HIV within an infected individual and elucidate the influence of recombination. We find, interestingly, that when the effective population size of HIV is small, recombination increases both the diversity and the mean fitness of the viral population. When the effective population size is large, recombination increases viral fitness but decreases diversity. In effect, recombination enhances (lowers) the likelihood of the existence of multi-drug resistant strains of HIV in infected individuals prior to the onset of therapy when the effective population size is small (large). Our simulations are consistent with several recent experimental observations, including the evolution of HIV diversity and divergence in vivo. The intriguing dependencies on the effective population size appear due to the subtle interplay of drift, selection and epistasis, which we discuss in the light of modern population genetics theories. Current estimates of the effective population size of HIV have large discrepancies. Our simulations present an avenue for accurate determination of the effective population size of HIV in vivo and facilitate establishment of the benefit of recombination to HIV.},

title = {Levels of naturally occurring DNA polymorphism correlate with recombination rates in {D.}~melanogaster},
abstract = {Two genomic regions with unusually low recombination rates in Drosophila melanogaster have normal levels of divergence but greatly reduced nucleotide diversity, apparently resulting from the fixation of advantageous mutations and the associated hitch-hiking effect. Here we show that for 20 gene regions from across the genome, the amount of nucleotide diversity in natural populations of D. melanogaster is positively correlated with the regional rate of recombination. This cannot be explained by variation in mutation rates and/or functional constraint, because we observe no correlation between recombination rates and DNA sequence divergence between D. melanogaster and its sibling species, D. simulans. We suggest that the correlation may result from genetic hitch-hiking associated with the fixation of advantageous mutants. Hitch-hiking thus seems to occur over a large fraction of the Drosophila genome and may constitute a major constraint on levels of genetic variation in nature.},

title = {Genetic basis of evolutionary adaptation by Escherichia coli to stressful cycles of freezing, thawing and growth},
abstract = {Microbial evolution experiments offer a powerful approach for coupling changes in complex phenotypes, including fitness and its components, with specific mutations. Here we investigate mutations substituted in 15 lines of Escherichia coli that evolved for 1000 generations under freeze-thaw-growth (FTG) conditions. To investigate the genetic basis of their improvements, we screened many of the lines for mutations involving insertion sequence (IS) elements and identified two genes where multiple lines had similar mutations. Three lines had IS150 insertions in cls, which encodes cardiolipin synthase, and 8 lines had IS150 insertions in the uspA-uspB intergenic region, encoding two universal stress proteins. Another line had an 11-bp deletion mutation in the cls gene. Strain reconstructions and competitions demonstrated that this deletion is beneficial under the FTG regime in its evolved genetic background. Further experiments showed that this cls mutation helps maintain membrane fluidity after freezing and thawing and improves freeze-thaw (FT) survival. Reconstruction of isogenic strains also showed that the IS150 insertions in uspA/B are beneficial under the FTG regime. The evolved insertions reduce uspB transcription and increase both FT survival and recovery, but the physiological mechanism for this fitness improvement remains unknown.},

title = {Genome-wide patterns of adaptation to temperate environments associated with transposable elements in Drosophila},
abstract = {Investigating spatial patterns of loci under selection can give insight into how populations evolved in response to selective pressures and can provide monitoring tools for detecting the impact of environmental changes on populations. Drosophila is a particularly good model to study adaptation to environmental heterogeneity since it is a tropical species that originated in sub-Saharan Africa and has only recently colonized the rest of the world. There is strong evidence for the adaptive role of Transposable Elements (TEs) in the evolution of Drosophila, and TEs might play an important role specifically in adaptation to temperate climates. In this work, we analyzed the frequency of a set of putatively adaptive and putatively neutral TEs in populations with contrasting climates that were collected near the endpoints of two known latitudinal clines in Australia and North America. The contrasting results obtained for putatively adaptive and putatively neutral TEs and the consistency of the patterns between continents strongly suggest that putatively adaptive TEs are involved in adaptation to temperate climates. We integrated information on population behavior, possible environmental selective agents, and both molecular and functional information of the TEs and their nearby genes to infer the plausible phenotypic consequences of these insertions. We conclude that adaptation to temperate environments is widespread in Drosophila and that TEs play a significant role in this adaptation. It is remarkable that such a diverse set of TEs located next to a diverse set of genes are consistently adaptive to temperate climate-related factors. We argue that reverse population genomic analyses, as the one described in this work, are necessary to arrive at a comprehensive picture of adaptation.},

title = {Detecting coevolution in and among protein domains},
abstract = {Correlated changes of nucleic or amino acids have provided strong information about the structures and interactions of molecules. Despite the rich literature in coevolutionary sequence analysis, previous methods often have to trade off between generality, simplicity, phylogenetic information, and specific knowledge about interactions. Furthermore, despite the evidence of coevolution in selected protein families, a comprehensive screening of coevolution among all protein domains is still lacking. We propose an augmented continuous-time Markov process model for sequence coevolution. The model can handle different types of interactions, incorporate phylogenetic information and sequence substitution, has only one extra free parameter, and requires no knowledge about interaction rules. We employ this model to large-scale screenings on the entire protein domain database (Pfam). Strikingly, with 0.1 trillion tests executed, the majority of the inferred coevolving protein domains are functionally related, and the coevolving amino acid residues are spatially coupled. Moreover, many of the coevolving positions are located at functionally important sites of proteins/protein complexes, such as the subunit linkers of superoxide dismutase, the tRNA binding sites of ribosomes, the DNA binding region of RNA polymerase, and the active and ligand binding sites of various enzymes. The results suggest sequence coevolution manifests structural and functional constraints of proteins. The intricate relations between sequence coevolution and various selective constraints are worth pursuing at a deeper level.},

abstract = {Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is a major aspect of the organization of genetic variation in natural populations. Here we describe the genome-wide pattern of LD in a sample of 19 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions using 341,602 non-singleton SNPs. LD decays within 10 kb on average, considerably faster than previously estimated. Tag SNP selection algorithms and 'hide-the-SNP' simulations suggest that genome-wide association mapping will require only 40%-50% of the observed SNPs, a reduction similar to estimates in a sample of African Americans. An Affymetrix genotyping array containing 250,000 SNPs has been designed based on these results; we demonstrate that it should have more than adequate coverage for genome-wide association mapping. The extent of LD is highly variable, and we find clear evidence of recombination hotspots, which seem to occur preferentially in intergenic regions. LD also reflects the action of selection, and it is more extensive between nonsynonymous polymorphisms than between synonymous polymorphisms.},

abstract = {Wright's adaptive topography describes gene frequency evolution as a maximization of mean fitness in a constant environment. I extended this to a fluctuating environment by unifying theories of stochastic demography and fluctuating selection, assuming small or moderate fluctuations in demographic rates with a stationary distribution, and weak selection among the types. The demography of a large population, composed of haploid genotypes at a single locus or normally distributed phenotypes, can then be approximated as a diffusion process and transformed to produce the dynamics of population size, N, and gene frequency, p, or mean phenotype, . The expected evolution of p or is a product of genetic variability and the gradient of the long-run growth rate of the population, , with respect to p or . This shows that the expected evolution maximizes , the mean Malthusian fitness in the average environment minus half the environmental variance in population growth rate. Thus, as a function of p or represents an adaptive topography that, despite environmental fluctuations, does not change with time. The haploid model is dominated by environmental stochasticity, so the expected maximization is not realized. Different constraints on quantitative genetic variability, and stabilizing selection in the average environment, allow evolution of the mean phenotype to undergo a stochastic maximization of . Although the expected evolution maximizes the long-run growth rate of the population, for a genotype or phenotype the long-run growth rate is not a valid measure of fitness in a fluctuating environment. The haploid and quantitative character models both reveal that the expected relative fitness of a type is its Malthusian fitness in the average environment minus the environmental covariance between its growth rate and that of the population.},

As a consequence, resistance testing is the standard of care. Because of the high degree of HIV-1 natural variation and complex interactions, the role of resistance mutations is in many cases insufficiently understood. We applied a probabilistic model, Bayesian networks, to analyze direct influences between protein residues and exposure to treatment in clinical HIV-1 protease sequences from diverse subtypes. We can determine the specific role of many resistance mutations against the protease inhibitor nelfinavir, and determine relationships between resistance mutations and polymorphisms. We can show for example that in addition to the well-known major mutations 90M and 30N for nelfinavir resistance, 88S should not be treated as 88D but instead considered as a major mutation and explain the subtype-dependent prevalence of the 30N resistance pathway.},

We examined genome-wide microsatellite data for 23,066 individuals, providing information on recombination events of 14,140 maternal and paternal meioses each, and found a positive correlation between maternal recombination counts of an offspring and maternal age. We postulated that the recombination rate of eggs does not increase with maternal age, but that the apparent increase is the consequence of selection. Specifically, a high recombination count increased the chance of a gamete becoming a live birth, and this effect became more pronounced with advancing maternal age. Further support for this hypothesis came from our observation that mothers with high oocyte recombination rate tend to have more children. Hence, not only do recombinations have a role in evolution by yielding diverse combinations of gene variants for natural selection, but they are also under selection themselves.},

title = {The energy landscapes of repeat-containing proteins: topology, cooperativity, and the folding funnels of one-dimensional architectures},
abstract = {Repeat-proteins are made up of near repetitions of 20- to 40-amino acid stretches. These polypeptides usually fold up into non-globular, elongated architectures that are stabilized by the interactions within each repeat and those between adjacent repeats, but that lack contacts between residues distant in sequence. The inherent symmetries both in primary sequence and three-dimensional structure are reflected in a folding landscape that may be analyzed as a quasi-one-dimensional problem. We present a general description of repeat-protein energy landscapes based on a formal Ising-like treatment of the elementary interaction energetics in and between foldons, whose collective ensemble are treated as spin variables. The overall folding properties of a complete "domain" (the stability and cooperativity of the repeating array) can be derived from this microscopic description. The one-dimensional nature of the model implies there are simple relations for the experimental observables: folding free-energy (DeltaG(water)) and the cooperativity of denaturation (m-value), which do not ordinarily apply for globular proteins. We show how the parameters for the "coarse-grained" description in terms of foldon spin variables can be extracted from more detailed folding simulations on perfectly funneled landscapes. To illustrate the ideas, we present a case-study of a family of tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeat proteins and quantitatively relate the results to the experimentally observed folding transitions. Based on the dramatic effect that single point mutations exert on the experimentally observed folding behavior, we speculate that natural repeat proteins are "poised" at particular ratios of inter- and intra-element interaction energetics that allow them to readily undergo structural transitions in physiologically relevant conditions, which may be intrinsically related to their biological functions.},

title = {ADAPTIVE POPULATION DIVERGENCE IN CRYPTIC COLOR-PATTERN FOLLOWING A REDUCTION IN GENE FLOW},
abstract = {ABSTRACT Adaptive population divergence is often driven by divergent natural selection, but can be constrained by the homogenizing effect of gene flow between populations. Indeed, a common pattern in nature is an inverse correlation between the degree of adaptive phenotypic divergence between populations and levels of gene flow between populations. However, there is essentially no experimental data on whether this correlation arises because gene flow constrains adaptation or, conversely, because adaptive divergence causes barriers to gene flow ('ecological speciation'). Here, I report increased adaptive divergence in cryptic color pattern between a pair of Timema insect populations following an experimental reduction in between-population gene flow. The reduction in gene flow arose due to a natural experiment, and thus was not replicated at a second site. However, temporal replication of the trends among six generations of data, coupled with a lack of increased adaptive divergence for two other population pairs where gene flow was not manipulated (i.e. control sites), argues that the results did not arise by chance. Estimates of dispersal ability and population size further support reduced gene flow, rather than increased genetic drift, as the cause of divergence. Thus, the findings provide experimental evidence that gene flow constrains adaptation in nature.},

title = {Variations in DNA elucidate molecular networks that cause disease},
abstract = {Identifying variations in DNA that increase susceptibility to disease is one of the primary aims of genetic studies using a forward genetics approach. However, identification of disease-susceptibility genes by means of such studies provides limited functional information on how genes lead to disease. In fact, in most cases there is an absence of functional information altogether, preventing a definitive identification of the susceptibility gene or genes. Here we develop an alternative to the classic forward genetics approach for dissecting complex disease traits where, instead of identifying susceptibility genes directly affected by variations in DNA, we identify gene networks that are perturbed by susceptibility loci and that in turn lead to disease. Application of this method to liver and adipose gene expression data generated from a segregating mouse population results in the identification of a macrophage-enriched network supported as having a causal relationship with disease traits associated with metabolic syndrome. Three genes in this network, lipoprotein lipase (Lpl), lactamase beta (Lactb) and protein phosphatase 1-like (Ppm1l), are validated as previously unknown obesity genes, strengthening the association between this network and metabolic disease traits. Our analysis provides direct experimental support that complex traits such as obesity are emergent properties of molecular networks that are modulated by complex genetic loci and environmental factors.},

title = {The evolution of domain-content in bacterial genomes},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Across all sequenced bacterial genomes, the number of domains nc in different functional categories c scales as a power-law in the total number of domains n, i.e. nc proportional n(alpha)c, with exponents alpha(c) that vary across functional categories. Here we investigate the implications of these scaling laws for the evolution of domain-content in bacterial genomes and derive the simplest evolutionary model consistent with these scaling laws. RESULTS: We show that, using only an assumption of time invariance, the scaling laws uniquely determine the relative rates of domain additions and deletions across all functional categories and evolutionary lineages. In particular, the model predicts that the rate of additions and deletions of domains of category c is proportional to the number of domains nc currently in the genome and we discuss the implications of this observation for the role of horizontal transfer in genome evolution. Second, in addition to being proportional to nc, the rate of additions and deletions of domains of category c is proportional to a category-dependent constant rho(c), which is the same for all evolutionary lineages. This 'evolutionary potential' rho(c) represents the relative probability for additions/deletions of domains of category c to be fixed in the population by selection and is predicted to equal the scaling exponent alpha(c). By comparing the domain content of 93 pairs of closely-related genomes from all over the phylogenetic tree of bacteria, we demonstrate that the model's predictions are supported by available genome-sequence data. CONCLUSION: Our results establish a direct quantitative connection between the scaling of domain numbers with genome size, and the rate of addition and deletions of domains during short evolutionary time intervals.of domain numbers with genome size, and the rate of addition and deletions of domains during short evolutionary time intervals.},

abstract = {Sponges (Porifera) represent the most basal branch of the Metazoa alive today. We show that two central stress-activated protein kinases involved in the osmosensing pathway, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and JNK, can complement for the ancestral MAPK Hog1 in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. S. cerevisiae mutants lacking Hog1 (hog1-Delta 1) have been complemented with the sponge SDJNK and SDp38 genes. Western blotting has revealed that, after transformation, the hog1-Delta 1+ SDJNK(sense) and hog1-Delta 1+ SDp38(sense) clones express the sponge proteins. Functional studies have demonstrated that the complemented clones grow under hyperosmotic conditions (0.6 M NaCl). Furthermore, the expressed sponge kinases undergo phosphorylation in S. cerevisiae at 0.6 M NaCl. This report documents that the metazoan signal transduction kinases, p38 and JNK, which were originally derived from an common ancestor with yeast HOG1, have retained their function after their specification.},

title = {What role does natural selection play in speciation?},
abstract = {If distinct biological species are to coexist in sympatry, they must be reproductively isolated and must exploit different limiting resources. A two-niche Levene model is analysed, in which habitat preference and survival depend on underlying additive traits. The population genetics of preference and viability are equivalent. However, there is a linear trade-off between the chances of settling in either niche, whereas viabilities may be constrained arbitrarily. With a convex trade-off, a sexual population evolves a single generalist genotype, whereas with a concave trade-off, disruptive selection favours maximal variance. A pure habitat preference evolves to global linkage equilibrium if mating occurs in a single pool, but remarkably, evolves to pairwise linkage equilibrium within niches if mating is within those niches--independent of the genetics. With a concave trade-off, the population shifts sharply between a unimodal distribution with high gene flow and a bimodal distribution with strong isolation, as the underlying genetic variance increases. However, these alternative states are only simultaneously stable for a narrow parameter range. A sharp threshold is only seen if survival in the 'wrong' niche is low; otherwise, strong isolation is impossible. Gene flow from divergent demes makes speciation much easier in parapatry than in sympatry.},

abstract = {Experiments reported here test two hypotheses about the evolution of recombination: first, the Fisher-Muller concept that sexual organisms respond to selection more rapidly than do asexual ones, and second, that epistasis is more likely to evolve in the absence of recombination. Populations of bacterio-phage T4 were selected by the drug proflavine in discrete generations and the change in mean population fitness was monitored. Three separate selection series yielded results supporting the Fisher-Muller hypothesis. The amount of epistasis evolved was measured by partitioning the T4 map into regions and comparing the sum of the proflavine resistances of each region with the resistance of the whole. Significantly more interactions were found in phage isolated from the populations with lower total recombination than in those from populations with higher recombination. The degree to which these experiments fit preconceived notions about natural selection suggests that microorganisms may be advantageously used in other population genetics experiments.},

title = {Evolution of two-component signal transduction},
abstract = {Two-component signal transduction (TCST) systems are the principal means for coordinating responses to environmental changes in bacteria as well as some plants, fungi, protozoa, and archaea. These systems typically consist of a receptor histidine kinase, which reacts to an extracellular signal by phosphorylating a cytoplasmic response regulator, causing a change in cellular behavior. Although several model systems, including sporulation and chemotaxis, have been extensively studied, the evolutionary relationships between specific TCST systems are not well understood, and the ancestry of the signal transduction components is unclear. Phylogenetic trees of TCST components from 14 complete and 6 partial genomes, containing 183 histidine kinases and 220 response regulators, were constructed using distance methods. The trees showed extensive congruence in the positions of 11 recognizable phylogenetic clusters. Eukaryotic sequences were found almost exclusively in one cluster, which also showed the greatest extent of domain variability in its component proteins, and archaeal sequences mainly formed species-specific clusters. Three clusters in different parts of the kinase tree contained proteins with serine-phosphorylating activity. All kinases were found to be monophyletic with respect to other members of their superfamily, such as type II topoisomerases and Hsp90. Structural analysis further revealed significant similarity to the ATP-binding domain of eukaryotic protein kinases. TCST systems are of bacterial origin and radiated into archaea and eukaryotes by lateral gene transfer. Their components show extensive coevolution, suggesting that recombination has not been a major factor in their differentiation. Although histidine kinase activity is prevalent, serine kinases have evolved multiple times independently within this family, accompanied by a loss of the cognate response regulator(s). The structural and functional similarity between TCST kinases and eukaryotic protein kinases raises the possibility of a distant evolutionary relationship.},

title = {Darwinian evolution can follow only very few mutational paths to fitter proteins},
abstract = {Five point mutations in a particular beta-lactamase allele jointly increase bacterial resistance to a clinically important antibiotic by a factor of approximately 100,000. In principle, evolution to this high-resistance beta-lactamase might follow any of the 120 mutational trajectories linking these alleles. However, we demonstrate that 102 trajectories are inaccessible to Darwinian selection and that many of the remaining trajectories have negligible probabilities of realization, because four of these five mutations fail to increase drug resistance in some combinations. Pervasive biophysical pleiotropy within the beta-lactamase seems to be responsible, and because such pleiotropy appears to be a general property of missense mutations, we conclude that much protein evolution will be similarly constrained. This implies that the protein tape of life may be largely reproducible and even predictable.},

title = {Three-dimensional FRET reconstruction microscopy for analysis of dynamic molecular interactions in live cells},
abstract = {Analysis of cellular pathways requires concentration measurements of dynamically interacting molecules within the three-dimensional (3D) space of single living cells. F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy from widefield, from confocal, and potentially from superresolution microscopes can access this information; however, these measurements are distorted by the inherent 3D blurring of optical imaging, spectral overlap of fluorophores, and detection noise. We propose a mathematical model of these processes and demonstrate, through simulation, how these distortions limit the dynamic range and sensitivity of conventional FRET microscopy. Using this model, we devise and validate a new approach (called 3D-FRET stoichiometry reconstruction, 3DFSR) for reconstructing 3D distributions of bound and free fluorescent molecules. Previous attempts to reconstruct 3D-FRET data relied on sequential spectral unmixing and deconvolution, a process that corrupts the detection statistics. We demonstrate that 3DFSR is superior to these approaches since it simultaneously models spectral mixing, optical blurring, and detection noise. To achieve the full potential of this technique, we developed an instrument capable of acquiring 3D-FRET data rapidly and sensitively from single living cells. Compared with conventional FRET microscopy, our 3D-FRET reconstruction technique and new instrumentation provides orders of magnitude gains in both sensitivity and accuracy wherein sustained high-resolution four-dimensional (x,y,z,t) imaging of molecular interactions inside living cells was achieved. These results verify previous observations that Cdc42 signaling is localized to the advancing margins of forming phagosomes in macrophages.},

William B. Provine once remarked that the Fisher-Wright controversy is central, fundamental, and very influential. Indeed, it is also persistent. The argumentative structure of the recent (1997-2000) debates is analyzed with the aim of eliminating a logical conflict in them, viz., that the two "sides" in the debates have different aims and that, as such, they are talking past each other. Given a philosophical analysis of the argumentative structure of the debates, suggestions supportive of Wade's work on the debate are made that are aimed, modestly, at putting the persistent Fisher-Wright controversy on the course to resolution.},

Here we present a high-resolution map of Pol II occupancy across the entire yeast genome. We compared a wild-type strain with a strain bearing a substitution in the Sen1 helicase, which is a Pol II termination factor for noncoding RNA genes. The wild-type pattern of Pol II distribution provides unexpected insights into the mechanisms by which genes are repressed or silenced. Remarkably, a single amino acid substitution that compromises Sen1 function causes profound changes in Pol II distribution over both noncoding and protein-coding genes, establishing an important function of Sen1 in the regulation of transcription. Given the strong similarity of the yeast and human Sen1 proteins, our results suggest that progressive neurological disorders caused by substitutions in the human Sen1 homolog Senataxin may be due to misregulation of transcription.},

The origin of isochores is still controversial: various neutral and selectionist models have been proposed--and criticized--since the discovery of isochores in the 1970s. The availability of complete mammalian genomes has yielded new opportunities for addressing this question. In particular, it was recently proposed that (i) the isochore structure is declining in many mammalian groups, and that (ii) GC-content is influenced by local recombination rate, possibly via the mechanism of GC-biased gene conversion. In this article we review the existing support for these two hypotheses, and discuss how they can be combined to provide a new perspective on isochore evolution.},

After a single infection cycle, breakpoints clustered in regions corresponding to the constant portions of Env. With some exceptions, a similar distribution was observed after multiple infection cycles, and among recombinant sequences in the HIV Sequence Database. We compared the experimental data with computer simulations made using a program that only allows recombination to occur whenever an identical base is present in the aligned parental RNAs. Experimental recombination was more frequent than expected on the basis of simulated recombination when, in a region spanning 40 nt from the 5' border of a breakpoint, no more than two discordant bases between the parental RNAs were present. When these requirements were not fulfilled, breakpoints were distributed randomly along the RNA, closer to the distribution predicted by computer simulation. A significant preference for recombination was also observed for regions containing homopolymeric stretches. These results define, for the first time, local sequence determinants for recombination between divergent HIV-1 isolates.},

title = {Molecular analysis of an allozyme cline: alcohol dehydrogenase in Drosophila melanogaster on the east coast of North America},
abstract = {Clines may either be selectively maintained or be the by-product of nonadaptive processes related to population structure and history. Drosophila melanogaster populations on the east coast of North America show a latitudinal cline in the frequencies of two common electrophoretically distinguishable alleles at the alcohol dehydrogenase locus (Adh), designated Adh-S and Adh-F. This cline may either be adaptive or an artifact of a possible recent dual founding of North American D. melanogaster populations in which frequencies of Adh alleles differed between founder populations. By means of a high resolution restriction-mapping technique, we studied the distribution of 113 haplotypes derived from 44 polymorphic DNA markers within the Adh region in 1533 individuals from 25 populations throughout the cline. We found significant clinal differentiation at the polymorphism determining the mobility-difference causing amino acid replacement between Adh-F and Adh-S alleles. Hitchhiking was limited, despite extensive linkage disequilibrium, and other sites did not vary clinally. Such a pattern of differentiation implies that selection is responsible for the cline. To investigate whether selection acts only on the Adh-F/S site, we performed a "selective equivalence" test under the assumption that all variability within the specified allelic class is selectively neutral. This revealed selective equivalence among Adh-S-bearing haplotypes, whose frequencies showed no differentiation throughout the cline, implying high levels of frequency-homogenizing gene flow. Geographical heterogeneity among Adh-F-bearing haplotypes implied the action of selection on one or more additional variants in linkage disequilibrium with Adh-F. In a further study of a subset of the data (n = 1076 from 18 populations), we found a combined insertion/deletion polymorphism, designated delta 1, located in the 5' adult intron and in linkage disequilibrium with Adh-F, to show more marked clinal variation than Adh-F/S. Although the unequivocal identification of the precise target(s) of selection requires further study, we suggest that clinal selection may be acting epistatically on the Adh-F/S and delta 1 polymorphisms.},

abstract = {The transcriptional status of a gene can be maintained through multiple rounds of cell division during development. This epigenetic effect is believed to reflect heritable changes in chromatin folding and histone modifications or variants at target genes, but little is known about how these chromatin features are inherited through cell division. A particular challenge for maintaining transcription states is DNA replication, which disrupts or dilutes chromatin-associated proteins and histone modifications. PRC1-class Polycomb group protein complexes are essential for development and are thought to heritably silence transcription by altering chromatin folding and histone modifications. It is not known whether these complexes and their effects are maintained during DNA replication or subsequently re-established. We find that when PRC1-class Polycomb complex-bound chromatin or DNA is replicated in vitro, Polycomb complexes remain bound to replicated templates. Retention of Polycomb proteins through DNA replication may contribute to maintenance of transcriptional silencing through cell division.},

title = {Prevalence of drug resistance and importance of viral load measurements in Honduran HIV-infected patients failing antiretroviral treatment},
abstract = {Objective The Honduran HIV/AIDS Program began to scale up access to HIV therapy in 2002. Up to May 2008, more than 6000 patients received combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). As HIV drug resistance is the major obstacle for effective treatment, the purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of antiretroviral drug resistance in Honduran HIV-1-infected individuals. Methods We collected samples from 138 individuals (97 adults and 41 children) on cART with virological, immunological or clinical signs of treatment failure. HIV-1 pol sequences were obtained using an in-house method. Resistance mutations were identified according to the 2007 International AIDS Society (IAS)-USA list and predicted susceptibility to cART was scored using the anrs algorithm. Results Resistance mutations were detected in 112 patients (81%), 74% in adults and 98% in children. Triple-, dual- and single-class drug resistance was documented in 27%, 43% and 11% of the study subjects, respectively. Multiple logistic regression showed that resistance was independently associated with type of treatment failure [virological failure (odds ratio (OR)=1) vs. immunological failure (OR=0.11; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.030-0.43) vs. clinical failure (OR=0.037; 95% CI 0.0063-0.22)], route of transmission (OR=42.8; 95% CI 3.73-491), and years on therapy (OR=1.81; 95% CI 1.11-2.93). Conclusion The prevalence of antiretroviral resistance was high in Honduran HIV-infected patients with signs of treatment failure. A majority of study subjects showed dual- or triple-class resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. Virologically defined treatment failure was a strong predictor of resistance, indicating that viral load testing is needed to correctly identify patients with treatment failure attributable to resistance.},

title = {The dynamics of adaptation on correlated fitness landscapes},
abstract = {Evolutionary theory predicts that a population in a new environment will accumulate adaptive substitutions, but precisely how they accumulate is poorly understood. The dynamics of adaptation depend on the underlying fitness landscape. Virtually nothing is known about fitness landscapes in nature, and few methods allow us to infer the landscape from empirical data. With a view toward this inference problem, we have developed a theory that, in the weak-mutation limit, predicts how a population's mean fitness and the number of accumulated substitutions are expected to increase over time, depending on the underlying fitness landscape. We find that fitness and substitution trajectories depend not on the full distribution of fitness effects of available mutations but rather on the expected fixation probability and the expected fitness increment of mutations. We introduce a scheme that classifies landscapes in terms of the qualitative evolutionary dynamics they produce. We show that linear substitution trajectories, long considered the hallmark of neutral evolution, can arise even when mutations are strongly selected. Our results provide a basis for understanding the dynamics of adaptation and for inferring properties of an organism's fitness landscape from temporal data. Applying these methods to data from a long-term experiment, we infer the sign and strength of epistasis among beneficial mutations in the Escherichia coli genome.},

This genotypic diversity has been documented, for the most part, by sequencing of subgenomic segments of the provirus. Using DNA from virus cultures on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and recent improvements of the PCR technique, we have amplified virtually full-length HIV-1 genomes from genetic subtypes A through G of group M viruses and molecularly cloned several of them. Resequencing of the complete genome of a prototype strain after long PCR amplification and cloning has established a PCR error rate of 0.14%. We also report the first complete PCR-derived sequence of a U.S. clinical isolate of genotype B expanded only in primary PBMC; this provirus harbors a uniquely truncated V3 loop.},

abstract = {A correlation between diversity levels and rates of recombination is predicted both by models of positive selection, such as hitchhiking associated with the rapid fixation of advantageous mutations, and by models of purifying selection against strongly deleterious mutations (commonly referred to as "background selection"). With parameter values appropriate for Drosophila populations, only the first class of models predicts a marked skew in the frequency spectrum of linked neutral variants, relative to a neutral model. Here, we consider 29 loci scattered throughout the Drosophila melanogaster genome. We show that, in African populations, a summary of the frequency spectrum of polymorphic mutations is positively correlated with the meiotic rate of crossing over. This pattern is demonstrated to be unlikely under a model of background selection. Models of weakly deleterious selection are not expected to produce both the observed correlation and the extent to which nucleotide diversity is reduced in regions of low (but nonzero) recombination. Thus, of existing models, hitchhiking due to the recurrent fixation of advantageous variants is the most plausible explanation for the data.},

abstract = {Geographically separated populations of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus are sharply differentiated at several enzyme-encoding gene loci. Two studies were performed to investigate the extent to which the gene pools of local populations are organized into harmoniously interacting (or "coadapted") gene complexes. In the first, the effects of interpopulation hybridization on development time were assessed. Results showed that while F1 hybrids did not differ from parental lines, mean F2 developmental times were as much as 50% longer. The second study used two unlinked enzyme polymorphisms as genetic markers to determine the genotypic specificity of F2 hybrid breakdown. For two sets of parental populations, the relative viabilities of the different two-locus genotypes were determined from segregation ratios among the F2 progeny. Sharp deviations from Mendelian ratios were observed; in the extreme, a block of genes marked by the MeF allozyme from the LJ (La Jolla) population was found to be nearly lethal when homozygous in the F2 of LJ x AB (Los Angeles) crosses. This same block of genes had a tenfold higher viability in crosses between LJ and SC (Santa Cruz). In the AB x LJ crosses, the two marker loci had independent (multiplicative) effects on viability. In the SC x LJ crosses, deviations from the multiplicative model were observed; the data indicate that parental homozygous genotypes have higher viability than predicted by independence, while nonparental homozygotes have lower than predicted viability. These results suggest that substantial integration of the genome has occurred within natural T. californicus populations.},

abstract = {Somatic cells can be reprogrammed to a pluripotent state through the ectopic expression of defined transcription factors. Understanding the mechanism and kinetics of this transformation may shed light on the nature of developmental potency and suggest strategies with improved efficiency or safety. Here we report an integrative genomic analysis of reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts and B lymphocytes. Lineage-committed cells show a complex response to the ectopic expression involving induction of genes downstream of individual reprogramming factors. Fully reprogrammed cells show gene expression and epigenetic states that are highly similar to embryonic stem cells. In contrast, stable partially reprogrammed cell lines show reactivation of a distinctive subset of stem-cell-related genes, incomplete repression of lineage-specifying transcription factors, and DNA hypermethylation at pluripotency-related loci. These observations suggest that some cells may become trapped in partially reprogrammed states owing to incomplete repression of transcription factors, and that DNA de-methylation is an inefficient step in the transition to pluripotency. We demonstrate that RNA inhibition of transcription factors can facilitate reprogramming, and that treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors can improve the overall efficiency of the reprogramming process.},

abstract = {Myosin V is a two-headed molecular motor that binds six light chains per heavy chain, which creates unusually long lever arms. This motor moves processively along its actin track in discrete 36-nm steps. Our model is that one head of the two-headed myosin V tightly binds to actin and swings its long lever arm through a large angle, providing a stroke. We created single-headed constructs with different-size lever arms and show that stroke size is proportional to lever arm length. In a two-headed molecule, the stroke provides the directional bias, after which the unbound head diffuses to find its binding site, 36 nm forward. Our two-headed construct with all six light chains per head reconstitutes the 36-nm processive step seen in tissue-purified myosin V. Two-headed myosin V molecules with only four light chains per head are still processive, but their step size is reduced to 24 nm. A further reduction in the length of the lever arms to one light chain per head results in a motor that is unable to walk processively. This motor produces single small approx6-nm strokes, and ATPase and pyrene actin quench measurements show that only one of the heads of this dimer rapidly binds to actin for a given binding event. These data show that for myosin V with its normal proximal tail domain, both heads and a long lever arm are required for large, processive steps.},

title = {Using DNA mechanics to predict in vitro nucleosome positions and formation energies},
abstract = {In eukaryotic genomes, nucleosomes function to compact DNA and to regulate access to it both by simple physical occlusion and by providing the substrate for numerous covalent epigenetic tags. While competition with other DNA-binding factors and action of chromatin remodeling enzymes significantly affect nucleosome formation in vivo, nucleosome positions in vitro are determined by steric exclusion and sequence alone. We have developed a biophysical model, DNABEND, for the sequence dependence of DNA bending energies, and validated it against a collection of in vitro free energies of nucleosome formation and a set of in vitro nucleosome positions mapped at high resolution. We have also made a first ab initio prediction of nucleosomal DNA geometries, and checked its accuracy against the nucleosome crystal structure. We have used DNABEND to design both strong and weak histone- binding sequences, and measured the corresponding free energies of nucleosome formation. We find that DNABEND can successfully predict in vitro nucleosome positions and free energies, providing a physical explanation for the intrinsic sequence dependence of histone-DNA interactions.},

title = {Traversing the conceptual divide between biological and statistical epistasis: systems biology and a more modern synthesis},
abstract = {Epistasis plays an important role in the genetic architecture of common human diseases and can be viewed from two perspectives, biological and statistical, each derived from and leading to different assumptions and research strategies. Biological epistasis is the result of physical interactions among biomolecules within gene regulatory networks and biochemical pathways in an individual such that the effect of a gene on a phenotype is dependent on one or more other genes. In contrast, statistical epistasis is defined as deviation from additivity in a mathematical model summarizing the relationship between multilocus genotypes and phenotypic variation in a population. The goal of this essay is to review definitions and examples of biological and statistical epistasis and to explore the relationship between the two. Specifically, we present and discuss the following two questions in the context of human health and disease. First, when does statistical evidence of epistasis in human populations imply underlying biomolecular interactions in the etiology of disease? Second, when do biomolecular interactions produce patterns of statistical epistasis in human populations? Answers to these two reciprocal questions will provide an important framework for using genetic information to improve our ability to diagnose, prevent and treat common human diseases. We propose that systems biology will provide the necessary information for addressing these questions and that model systems such as bacteria, yeast and digital organisms will be a useful place to start.},

title = {Classification of hypotheses on the advantage of amphimixis},
abstract = {A classification of hypotheses on the advantage of amphimixis over apomixis is presented. According to "Immediate Benefit" hypotheses, amphimixis is advantageous regardless of reciprocal gene exchange, because either it directly increases fitness of the progeny, reduces the deleterious mutation rate, or makes selection more efficient. In contrast, "Variation and Selection" hypotheses attribute the advantage of amphimixis to the reciprocal gene exchange that alters genetic variability and response to selection among the progeny. Most such hypotheses assume that amphimixis increases variability and efficiency of selection, but some claim that amphimixis decreases response to selection. Variation and Selection hypotheses require that some factor, either random drift or epistatic selection, makes distributions of different alleles nonindependent, while another factor, either changes of the genotype fitnesses or deleterious mutations, makes overrepresented genotypes non-optimal. Numerous Variation and Selection hypotheses, dealing with either unstructured or spatially structured populations, are reviewed. Two of them seem most plausible: better responsiveness of the amphimictic population to widely fluctuating selection, and lower mutation load in the amphimictic population under synergistic selection against deleterious mutations. In both cases the large advantage of amphimixis requires rather stringent conditions, which could be falsified by careful experiment. Further progress in understanding the evolution of amphimixis will depend mostly on such experimental work.},

abstract = {Speciation often results from the accumulation of "complementary genes," i.e., from genes that, while having no deleterious effect within species, cause inviability or sterility when brought together with genes from another species. Here I model speciation as the accumulation of genic incompatibilities between diverging populations. Several results are obtained. First, and most important, the number of genic incompatibilities between taxa increases much faster than linearly with time. In particular, the probability of speciation increases at least as fast as the square of the time since separation between two taxa. Second, as Muller realized, all hybrid incompatibilities must initially be asymmetric. Third, at loci that have diverged between taxa, evolutionarily derived alleles cause hybrid problems far more often than ancestral alleles. Last, it is "easier" to evolve complex hybrid incompatibilities requiring the simultaneous action of three or more loci than to evolve simple incompatibilities between pairs of genes. These results have several important implications for genetic analyses of speciation.},

title = {Blind source separation techniques for the decomposition of multiply labeled fluorescence images},
abstract = {Methods of blind source separation are used in many contexts to separate composite data sets according to their sources. Multiply labeled fluorescence microscopy images represent such sets, in which the sources are the individual labels. Their distributions are the quantities of interest and have to be extracted from the images. This is often challenging, since the recorded emission spectra of fluorescent dyes are environment- and instrument-specific. We have developed a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm to detect and separate spectrally distinct components of multiply labeled fluorescence images. It operates on spectrally resolved images and delivers both the emission spectra of the identified components and images of their abundance. We tested the proposed method using biological samples labeled with up to four spectrally overlapping fluorescent labels. In most cases, NMF accurately decomposed the images into contributions of individual dyes. However, the solutions are not unique when spectra overlap strongly or when images are diffuse in their structure. To arrive at satisfactory results in such cases, we extended NMF to incorporate preexisting qualitative knowledge about spectra and label distributions. We show how data acquired through excitations at two or three different wavelengths can be integrated and that multiple excitations greatly facilitate the decomposition. By allowing reliable decomposition in cases where the spectra of the individual labels are not known or are known only inaccurately, the proposed algorithms greatly extend the range of questions that can be addressed with quantitative microscopy.},

abstract = {We analyze nucleotide polymorphism data for a large number of loci in areas of normal to high recombination in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans (24 and 16 loci, respectively). We find a genome-wide, systematic departure from the neutral expectation for a panmictic population at equilibrium in natural populations of both species. The distribution of sequence-based estimates of 2Nc across loci is inconsistent with the assumptions of the standard neutral theory, given the observed levels of nucleotide diversity and accepted values for recombination and mutation rates. Under these assumptions, most estimates of 2Nc are severalfold too low; in other words, both species exhibit greater intralocus linkage disequilibrium than expected. Variation in recombination or mutation rates is not sufficient to account for the excess of linkage disequilibrium. While an equilibrium island model does not seem to account for the data, more complicated forms of population structure may. A proper test of alternative demographic models will require loci to be sampled in a more consistent fashion.},

abstract = {The ability to image and quantitate fluorescently labeled markers in vivo has generally been limited by autofluorescence of the tissue. Skin, in particular, has a strong autofluorescence signal, particularly when excited in the blue or green wavelengths. Fluorescence labels with emission wavelengths in the near-infrared are more amenable to deep-tissue imaging, because both scattering and autofluorescence are reduced as wavelengths are increased, but even in these spectral regions, autofluorescence can still limit sensitivity. Multispectral imaging (MSI), however, can remove the signal degradation caused by autofluorescence while adding enhanced multiplexing capabilities. While the availability of spectral "libraries" makes multispectral analysis routine for well-characterized samples, new software tools have been developed that greatly simplify the application of MSI to novel specimens.},

title = {Flexible Histone Tails in a New Mesoscopic Oligonucleosome Model},
abstract = {We describe a new mesoscopic model of oligonucleosomes that incorporates flexible histone tails. The nucleosome cores are modeled using the discrete surface-charge optimization model, which treats the nucleosome as an electrostatic surface represented by hundreds of point charges; the linker DNAs are treated using a discrete elastic chain model; and the histone tails are modeled using a bead/chain hydrodynamic approach as chains of connected beads where each bead represents five protein residues. Appropriate charges and force fields are assigned to each histone chain so as to reproduce the electrostatic potential, structure, and dynamics of the corresponding atomistic histone tails at different salt conditions. The dynamics of resulting oligonucleosomes at different sizes and varying salt concentrations are simulated by Brownian dynamics with complete hydrodynamic interactions. The analyses demonstrate that the new mesoscopic model reproduces experimental results better than its predecessors, which modeled histone tails as rigid entities. In particular, our model with flexible histone tails: correctly accounts for salt-dependent conformational changes in the histone tails; yields the experimentally obtained values of histone-tail mediated core/core attraction energies; and considers the partial shielding of electrostatic repulsion between DNA linkers as a result of the spatial distribution of histone tails. These effects are crucial for regulating chromatin structure but are absent or improperly treated in models with rigid histone tails. The development of this model of oligonucleosomes thus opens new avenues for studying the role of histone tails and their variants in mediating gene expression through modulation of chromatin structure.},

title = {Simple model for the DNA denaturation transition},
abstract = {We study pairs of interacting self-avoiding walks ¿omega(1), omega(2)¿ on the 3d simple cubic lattice. They have a common origin omega(1)(0)=omega 20, and are allowed to overlap only at the same monomer position along the chain: omega(1)(i) not equal omega(2)(j) for i not equal j, while omega(1)(i)=omega(2)(i) is allowed. The latter overlaps are indeed favored by an energetic gain epsilon. This is inspired by a model introduced long ago by Poland and Sheraga [J. Chem. Phys. 45, 1464 (1966)] for the denaturation transition in DNA where, however, self avoidance was not fully taken into account. For both models, there exists a temperature T(m) above which the entropic advantage to open up overcomes the energy gained by forming tightly bound two-stranded structures. Numerical simulations of our model indicate that the transition is of first order (the energy density is discontinuous), but the analog of the surface tension vanishes and the scaling laws near the transition point are exactly those of a second-order transition with crossover exponent straight phi=1. Numerical and exact analytic results show that the transition is second order in modified models where the self-avoidance is partially or completely neglected.},

title = {Genes mirror geography within Europe},
abstract = {Understanding the genetic structure of human populations is of fundamental interest to medical, forensic and anthropological sciences. Advances in high-throughput genotyping technology have markedly improved our understanding of global patterns of human genetic variation and suggest the potential to use large samples to uncover variation among closely spaced populations. Here we characterize genetic variation in a sample of 3,000 European individuals genotyped at over half a million variable DNA sites in the human genome. Despite low average levels of genetic differentiation among Europeans, we find a close correspondence between genetic and geographic distances; indeed, a geographical map of Europe arises naturally as an efficient two-dimensional summary of genetic variation in Europeans. The results emphasize that when mapping the genetic basis of a disease phenotype, spurious associations can arise if genetic structure is not properly accounted for. In addition, the results are relevant to the prospects of genetic ancestry testing; an individual's DNA can be used to infer their geographic origin with surprising accuracy-often to within a few hundred kilometres.},

title = {HIV-1 evades antibody-mediated neutralization through conformational masking of receptor-binding sites},
abstract = {The ability of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) to persist and cause AIDS is dependent on its avoidance of antibody-mediated neutralization. The virus elicits abundant, envelope-directed antibodies that have little neutralization capacity. This lack of neutralization is paradoxical, given the functional conservation and exposure of receptor-binding sites on the gp120 envelope glycoprotein, which are larger than the typical antibody footprint and should therefore be accessible for antibody binding. Because gp120-receptor interactions involve conformational reorganization, we measured the entropies of binding for 20 gp120-reactive antibodies. Here we show that recognition by receptor-binding-site antibodies induces conformational change. Correlation with neutralization potency and analysis of receptor-antibody thermodynamic cycles suggested a receptor-binding-site 'conformational masking' mechanism of neutralization escape. To understand how such an escape mechanism would be compatible with virus-receptor interactions, we tested a soluble dodecameric receptor molecule and found that it neutralized primary HIV-1 isolates with great potency, showing that simultaneous binding of viral envelope glycoproteins by multiple receptors creates sufficient avidity to compensate for such masking. Because this solution is available for cell-surface receptors but not for most antibodies, conformational masking enables HIV-1 to maintain receptor binding and simultaneously to resist neutralization.},

abstract = {The ability to quantify the fluorescence signals from multiply labeled biological samples is highly desirable in the life sciences but often difficult, because of spectral overlap between fluorescent species and the presence of autofluorescence. Several so called unmixing algorithms have been developed to address this problem. Here, we present a novel algorithm that combines measurements of lifetime and spectrum to achieve unmixing without a priori information on the spectral properties of the fluorophore labels. The only assumption made is that the lifetimes of the fluorophores differ. Our method combines global analysis for a measurement of lifetime distributions with singular value decomposition to recover individual fluorescence spectra. We demonstrate the technique on simulated datasets and subsequently by an experiment on a biological sample. The method is computationally efficient and straightforward to implement. Applications range from histopathology of complex and multiply labelled samples to functional imaging in live cells.},

abstract = {Recent studies of the genetics of speciation in Drosophila have focused on two problems: (i) identifying and characterizing the genes that cause reproductive isolation, and (ii) determining the evolutionary forces that drove the divergence of these "speciation genes." Here, I review this work. I conclude that speciation genes correspond to ordinary loci having normal functions within species. These genes fall into several functional classes, although a role in transcriptional regulation could prove particularly common. More important, speciation genes are typically very rapidly evolving, and this divergence is often driven by positive Darwinian selection. Finally, I review recent work in Drosophila pseudoobscura on the possible role of meiotic drive in the evolution of the genes that cause postzygotic isolation.},

title = {Natural selection in action during speciation},
abstract = {The role of natural selection in speciation, first described by Darwin, has finally been widely accepted. Yet, the nature and time course of the genetic changes that result in speciation remain mysterious. To date, genetic analyses of speciation have focused almost exclusively on retrospective analyses of reproductive isolation between species or subspecies and on hybrid sterility or inviability rather than on ecologically based barriers to gene flow. However, if we are to fully understand the origin of species, we must analyze the process from additional vantage points. By studying the genetic causes of partial reproductive isolation between specialized ecological races, early barriers to gene flow can be identified before they become confounded with other species differences. This population-level approach can reveal patterns that become invisible over time, such as the mosaic nature of the genome early in speciation. Under divergent selection in sympatry, the genomes of incipient species become temporary genetic mosaics in which ecologically important genomic regions resist gene exchange, even as gene flow continues over most of the genome. Analysis of such mosaic genomes suggests that surprisingly large genomic regions around divergently selected quantitative trait loci can be protected from interrace recombination by "divergence hitchhiking." Here, I describe the formation of the genetic mosaic during early ecological speciation, consider the establishment, effects, and transitory nature of divergence hitchhiking around key ecologically important genes, and describe a 2-stage model for genetic divergence during ecological speciation with gene flow.},

title = {Gene surfing in expanding populations},
abstract = {Large scale genomic surveys are partly motivated by the idea that the neutral genetic variation of a population may be used to reconstruct its migration history. However, our ability to trace back the colonization pathways of a species from their genetic footprints is limited by our understanding of the genetic consequences of a range expansion. Here, we study, by means of simulations and analytical methods, the neutral dynamics of gene frequencies in an asexual population undergoing a continual range expansion in one dimension. During such a colonization period, lineages can fix at the wave front by means of a "surfing" mechanism [Edmonds, C.A., Lillie, A.S., Cavalli-Sforza, L.L., 2004. Mutations arising in the wave front of an expanding population. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 101, 975-979]. We quantify this phenomenon in terms of (i) the spatial distribution of lineages that reach fixation and, closely related, (ii) the continual loss of genetic diversity (heterozygosity) at the wave front, characterizing the approach to fixation. Our stochastic simulations show that an effective population size can be assigned to the wave that controls the (observable) gradient in heterozygosity left behind the colonization process. This effective population size is markedly higher in the presence of cooperation between individuals ("pushed waves") than when individuals proliferate independently ("pulled waves"), and increases only sub-linearly with deme size. To explain these and other findings, we develop a versatile analytical approach, based on the physics of reaction-diffusion systems, that yields simple predictions for any deterministic population dynamics. Our analytical theory compares well with the simulation results for pushed waves, but is less accurate in the case of pulled waves when stochastic fluctuations in the tip of the wave are important.},

abstract = {The rapid evolution of drug resistance remains a major obstacle for HIV therapy. The capacity of the virus for recombination is widely believed to facilitate the evolution of drug resistance. Here, we challenge this intuitive view. We develop a population genetic model of HIV replication that incorporates the processes of mutation, cellular superinfection, and recombination. We show that cellular superinfection increases the abundance of low fitness viruses at the expense of the fittest strains due to the mixing of viral proteins during virion assembly. Moreover, we argue that whether recombination facilitates the evolution of drug resistance depends critically on how resistance mutations interact to determine viral fitness. Contrary to the commonly held belief, we find that, under the most plausible biological assumptions, recombination is expected to slow down the rate of evolution of multi-drug-resistant virus during therapy.},

title = {Impact of diabetes susceptibility loci on progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes in at-risk individuals of the diabetes prevention trial-type 1 (DPT-1)},
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The unfolding of type 1 diabetes involves a number of steps: defective immunological tolerance, priming of anti-islet autoimmunity, and destruction of insulin-producing beta-cells. A number of genetic loci contribute to susceptibility to type 1 diabetes, but it is unclear which stages of the disease are influenced by the different loci. Here, we analyzed the frequency of type 1 diabetes-risk alleles among individuals from the Diabetes Prevention Trial-Type 1 (DPT-1) clinical trial, which tested a preventive effect of insulin in at-risk relatives of diabetic individuals, all of which presented with autoimmune manifestations but only one-third of which eventually progressed to diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, 708 individuals randomized into DPT-1 were genotyped for 37 single nucleotide polymorphisms in diabetes susceptibility loci. RESULTS: Susceptibility alleles at loci expected to influence immunoregulation (PTPN22, CTLA4, and IL2RA) did not differ between progressors and nonprogressors but were elevated in both groups relative to general population frequencies, as was the INS promoter variant. In contrast, HLA DQB1*0302 and DQB1*0301 differed significantly in progressors versus nonprogressors (DQB*0302, 42.6 vs. 34.7%, P = 0.0047; DQB*0301, 8.6 vs. 14.3%, P = 0.0026). Multivariate analysis of the factors contributing to progression demonstrated that initial titers of anti-insulin autoantibodies (IAAs) could account for some (P = 0.0016) but not all of this effect on progression (P = 0.00038 for the independent effect of the number of DQB*0302 alleles). The INS-23 genotype was most strongly associated with anti-IAAs (median IAA levels in TT individuals, 60 nU/ml; AT, 121; and AA, 192; P = 0.000037) and only suggestively to the outcome of oral insulin administration. CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of HLA, most susceptibility loci tested condition the risk of autoimmunity rather than the risk of failed immunoregulation that results in islet destruction. Future clinical trials might consider genotyping INS-23 in addition to HLA alleles as disease/treatment response modifier.},

title = {Identifying the important HIV-1 recombination breakpoints},
abstract = {Recombinant HIV-1 genomes contribute significantly to the diversity of variants within the HIV/AIDS pandemic. It is assumed that some of these mosaic genomes may have novel properties that have led to their prevalence, particularly in the case of the circulating recombinant forms (CRFs). In regions of the HIV-1 genome where recombination has a tendency to convey a selective advantage to the virus, we predict that the distribution of breakpoints--the identifiable boundaries that delimit the mosaic structure--will deviate from the underlying null distribution. To test this hypothesis, we generate a probabilistic model of HIV-1 copy-choice recombination and compare the predicted breakpoint distribution to the distribution from the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Across much of the HIV-1 genome, we find that the observed frequencies of inter-subtype recombination are predicted accurately by our model. This observation strongly indicates that in these regions a probabilistic model, dependent on local sequence identity, is sufficient to explain breakpoint locations. In regions where there is a significant over- (either side of the env gene) or under- (short regions within gag, pol, and most of env) representation of breakpoints, we infer natural selection to be influencing the recombination pattern. The paucity of recombination breakpoints within most of the envelope gene indicates that recombinants generated in this region are less likely to be successful. The breakpoints at a higher frequency than predicted by our model are approximately at either side of env, indicating increased selection for these recombinants as a consequence of this region, or at least part of it, having a tendency to be recombined as an entire unit. Our findings thus provide the first clear indication of the existence of a specific portion of the genome that deviates from a probabilistic null model for recombination. This suggests that, despite the wide diversity of recombinant forms seen in the viral population, only a minority of recombination events appear to be of significance to the evolution of HIV-1.},

abstract = {Photoreceptors of Drosophila compound eye employ a G protein-mediated signaling pathway that transduces single photons into transient electrical responses called "quantum bumps" (QB). Although most of the molecular components of this pathway are already known, the system-level understanding of the mechanism of QB generation has remained elusive. Here, we present a quantitative model explaining how QBs emerge from stochastic nonlinear dynamics of the signaling cascade. The model shows that the cascade acts as an "integrate and fire" device and explains how photoreceptors achieve reliable responses to light although keeping low background in the dark. The model predicts the nontrivial behavior of mutants that enhance or suppress signaling and explains the dependence on external calcium, which controls feedback regulation. The results provide insight into physiological questions such as single-photon response efficiency and the adaptation of response to high incident-light level. The system-level analysis enabled by modeling phototransduction provides a foundation for understanding G protein signaling pathways less amenable to quantitative approaches.},

title = {Intragenic Hill-Robertson interference influences selection intensity on synonymous mutations in Drosophila},
abstract = {Natural selection influences synonymous mutations and synonymous codon usage in many eukaryotes to improve the efficiency of translation in highly expressed genes. Recent studies of gene composition in eukaryotes have shown that codon usage also varies independently of expression levels, both among genes and at the intragenic level. Here, we investigate rates of evolution (Ks) and intensity of selection (gamma(s)) on synonymous mutations in two groups of genes that differ greatly in the length of their exons, but with equivalent levels of gene expression and rates of crossing-over in Drosophila melanogaster. We estimate gamma(s) using patterns of divergence and polymorphism in 50 Drosophila genes (100 kb of coding sequence) to take into account possible variation in mutation trends across the genome, among genes or among codons. We show that genes with long exons exhibit higher Ks and reduced gamma(s) compared to genes with short exons. We also show that Ks and gamma(s) vary significantly across long exons, with higher Ks and reduced gamma(s) in the central region compared to flanking regions of the same exons, hence indicating that the difference between genes with short and long exons can be mostly attributed to the central region of these long exons. Although amino acid composition can also play a significant role when estimating Ks and gamma(s), our analyses show that the differences in Ks and gamma(s) between genes with short and long exons and across long exons cannot be explained by differences in protein composition. All these results are consistent with the Interference Selection (IS) model that proposes that the Hill-Robertson (HR) effect caused by many weakly selected mutations has detectable evolutionary consequences at the intragenic level in genomes with recombination. Under the IS model, exon size and exon-intron structure influence the effectiveness of selection, with long exons showing reduced effectiveness of selection when compared to small exons and the central region of long exons showing reduced intensity of selection compared to flanking coding regions. Finally, our results further stress the need to consider selection on synonymous mutations and its variation--among and across genes and exons--in studies of protein evolution.},

For the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we developed a method termed Synthetic Genetic Array (SGA) analysis, which offers an efficient approach for the systematic construction of double mutants and enables a global analysis of synthetic lethal genetic interactions. In a typical SGA screen, a query mutation is crossed to an ordered array of approx 5000 viable gene deletion mutants (representing approximately 80% of all yeast genes) such that meiotic progeny harboring both mutations can be scored for fitness defects. This array-based approach automates yeast genetic analysis in general and can be easily adapted for a number of different screens, including genetic suppression, plasmid shuffling, dosage lethality, or suppression.},

abstract = {It has become clear that many organisms possess the ability to regulate their mutation rate in response to environmental conditions. So the question of finding an optimal mutation rate must be replaced by that of finding an optimal mutation schedule. We show that this task cannot be accomplished with standard population-dynamic models. We then develop a "hybrid" model for populations experiencing time-dependent mutation that treats population growth as deterministic but the time of first appearance of new variants as stochastic. We show that the hybrid model agrees well with a Monte Carlo simulation. From this model, we derive a deterministic approximation, a "threshold" model, that is similar to standard population dynamic models but differs in the initial rate of generation of new mutants. We use these techniques to model antibody affinity maturation by somatic hypermutation. We had previously shown that the optimal mutation schedule for the deterministic threshold model is phasic, with periods of mutation between intervals of mutation-free growth. To establish the validity of this schedule, we now show that the phasic schedule that optimizes the deterministic threshold model significantly improves upon the best constant-rate schedule for the hybrid and Monte Carlo models.},

abstract = {Evolution of reproductive isolation as a byproduct of genetic divergence in isolated populations is the dominant (albeit not exclusive) mode of speciation in sexual animals. But little is known about the factors linking speciation to general divergence. Several authors have argued that allopatric speciation should proceed more rapidly if isolated populations also experience divergent selection. Reproductive isolation between allopatric populations is not subject to direct selection; it can accumulate only by random drift or as a fortuitous byproduct of selection on other traits. Here I present a novel analysis of published data, demonstrating that pre- and postmating isolation of Drosophila species are more tightly correlated with allozyme divergence than with silent DNA divergence. Inasmuch as proteins are more subject to the action of natural selection than are silent DNA polymorphisms, this result provides broad support for a model of selection-mediated allopatric speciation.},

The loci are equivalent in their effect on disease risk and are in Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium. The goal is to determine what assumptions about dependence of disease risk on genotype are consistent with data for diseases such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, and multiple sclerosis that are relatively common (0.1-2% prevalence) and that have high concordance rates for monozygotic twins (30-50%) and high risks to first-degree relatives of affected individuals (risk ratios exceeding 4). These observations are consistent with a variety of models, including generalized additive, multiplicative, and threshold models, provided that disease risk increases rapidly for a narrow range of numbers of causative alleles. If causative alleles are in relatively high frequency, then the combined effects of numerous causative loci are necessary to substantially elevate disease risk.},

title = {Allopatric divergence, secondary contact, and genetic isolation in wild yeast populations},
abstract = {In plants and animals, new biological species clearly have arisen as a byproduct of genetic divergence in allopatry. However, our understanding of the processes that generate new microbial species remains limited [1] despite the large contribution of microbes to the world's biodiversity. A recent hypothesis claims that microbes lack biogeographical divergence because their population sizes are large and their migration rates are presumably high [2, 3]. In recapitulating the classic microbial-ecology dictum that "everything is everywhere, and the environment selects"[4, 5], this hypothesis casts doubt on whether geographic divergence promotes speciation in microbes. To date, its predictions have been tested primarily with data from eubacteria and archaebacteria [6-8]. However, this hypothesis's most important implication is in sexual eukaryotic microbes, where migration and genetic admixture are specifically predicted to inhibit allopatric divergence and speciation [9]. Here, we use nuclear-sequence data from globally distributed natural populations of the yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus to investigate the role of geography in generating diversity in sexual eukaryotic microbes. We show that these populations have undergone allopatric divergence and then secondary contact without genetic admixture. Our data thus support the occurrence of evolutionary processes necessary for allopatric speciation in sexual microbes.},

Whether kinesin moves by a "hand-over-hand" or an "inchworm" model has been controversial. We have labeled a single head of the kinesin dimer with a Cy3 fluorophore and localized the position of the dye to within 2 nm before and after a step. We observed that single kinesin heads take steps of 17.3 +/- 3.3 nm. A kinetic analysis of the dwell times between steps shows that the 17-nm steps alternate with 0-nm steps. These results strongly support a hand-over-hand mechanism, and not an inchworm mechanism. In addition, our results suggest that kinesin is bound by both heads to the microtubule while it waits for adenosine triphosphate in between steps.},

title = {Perspective: The theories of Fisher and Wright in the context of metapopulations: When nature does many small experiments},
abstract = {We critically review the two major theories of adaptive evolution developed early in this century, Wright's shifting balance theory and Fisher's large population size theory, in light of novel findings from field observations, laboratory experiments, and theoretical research conducted over the past 15 years. Ecological studies of metapopulations have established that the processes of local extinction and colonization of demes are relatively common in natural populations of many species and theoretical population genetic models have shown that these ecological processes have genetic consequences within and among local demes. Within demes, random genetic drift converts nonadditive genetic variance into additive genetic variance, increasing, rather than limiting, the potential for adaptation to local environments. For this reason, the genetic differences that arise by drift among demes, can be augmented by local selection. The resulting adaptive differences in gene combinations potentially contribute to the genetic origin of new species. These and other recent findings were not discussed by either Wright or Fisher. For example, although Wright emphasized epistatic genetic variance, he did not discuss the conversion process. Similarly, Fisher did not discuss how the average additive effect of a gene varies among demes across a metapopulation whenever there is epistasis. We discuss the implications of such recent findings for the Wright-Fisher controversy and identify some critical open questions that require additional empirical and theoretical study.},

title = {The extent of linkage disequilibrium in Arabidopsis thaliana},
abstract = {Linkage disequilibrium (LD), the nonrandom occurrence of alleles in haplotypes, has long been of interest to population geneticists. Recently, the rapidly increasing availability of genomic polymorphism data has fueled interest in LD as a tool for fine-scale mapping, in particular for human disease loci. The chromosomal extent of LD is crucial in this context, because it determines how dense a map must be for associations to be detected and, conversely, limits how finely loci may be mapped. Arabidopsis thaliana is expected to harbor unusually extensive LD because of its high degree of selfing. Several polymorphism studies have found very strong LD within individual loci, but also evidence of some recombination. Here we investigate the pattern of LD on a genomic scale and show that in global samples, LD decays within approximately 1 cM, or 250 kb. We also show that LD in local populations may be much stronger than that of global populations, presumably as a result of founder events. The combination of a relatively high level of polymorphism and extensive haplotype structure bodes well for developing a genome-wide LD map in A. thaliana.},

title = {Identifying currents in the gene pool for bacterial populations using an integrative approach},
abstract = {The evolution of bacterial populations has recently become considerably better understood due to large-scale sequencing of population samples. It has become clear that DNA sequences from a multitude of genes, as well as a broad sample coverage of a target population, are needed to obtain a relatively unbiased view of its genetic structure and the patterns of ancestry connected to the strains. However, the traditional statistical methods for evolutionary inference, such as phylogenetic analysis, are associated with several difficulties under such an extensive sampling scenario, in particular when a considerable amount of recombination is anticipated to have taken place. To meet the needs of large-scale analyses of population structure for bacteria, we introduce here several statistical tools for the detection and representation of recombination between populations. Also, we introduce a model-based description of the shape of a population in sequence space, in terms of its molecular variability and affinity towards other populations. Extensive real data from the genus Neisseria are utilized to demonstrate the potential of an approach where these population genetic tools are combined with an phylogenetic analysis. The statistical tools introduced here are freely available in BAPS 5.2 software, which can be downloaded from http://web.abo.fi/fak/mnf/mate/jc/software/baps.html.},

title = {Dissecting the architecture of a quantitative trait locus in yeast},
abstract = {Most phenotypic diversity in natural populations is characterized by differences in degree rather than in kind. Identification of the actual genes underlying these quantitative traits has proved difficult. As a result, little is known about their genetic architecture. The failures are thought to be due to the different contributions of many underlying genes to the phenotype and the ability of different combinations of genes and environmental factors to produce similar phenotypes. This study combined genome-wide mapping and a new genetic technique named reciprocal-hemizygosity analysis to achieve the complete dissection of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A QTL architecture was uncovered that was more complex than expected. Functional linkages both in cis and in trans were found between three tightly linked quantitative trait genes that are neither necessary nor sufficient in isolation. This arrangement of alleles explains heterosis (hybrid vigour), the increased fitness of the heterozygote compared with homozygotes. It also demonstrates a deficiency in current approaches to QTL dissection with implications extending to traits in other organisms, including human genetic diseases.},

abstract = {Effect of molecular crowding and confinement experienced by protein in the cell during unfolding has been studied by modeling a linear polymer chain on a percolation cluster. It is known that internal structure of the cell changes in time, however, they do not change significantly from their initial structure. In order to model this we introduce the correlation among the different disorder realizations. It was shown that the force-extension behavior for correlated disorder in both constant force ensemble and constant distance ensemble is significantly different than the one obtained in absence of molecular crowding.},

title = {Linkage and the limits to natural selection},
abstract = {The probability of fixation of a favorable mutation is reduced if selection at other loci causes inherited variation in fitness. A general method for calculating the fixation probability of an allele that can find itself in a variety of genetic backgrounds is applied to find the effect of substitutions, fluctuating polymorphisms, and deleterious mutations in a large population. With loose linkage, r, the effects depend on the additive genetic variance in relative fitness, var(W), and act by reducing effective population size by (N/Ne) = 1 + var(W)/2r2. However, tightly linked loci can have a substantial effect not predictable from Ne. Linked deleterious mutations reduce the fixation probability of weakly favored alleles by exp (-2U/R), where U is the total mutation rate and R is the map length in Morgans. Substitutions can cause a greater reduction: an allele with advantage s < scrit = (pi 2/6) loge (S/s) [var(W)/R] is very unlikely to be fixed. (S is the advantage of the substitution impeding fixation.) Fluctuating polymorphisms at many (n) linked loci can also have a substantial effect, reducing fixation probability by exp [square root of 2Kn var(W)/R] [K = -1/E((u-u)2/uv) depending on the frequencies (u,v) at the selected polymorphisms]. Hitchhiking due to all three kinds of selection may substantially impede adaptation that depends on weakly favored alleles.},

Our results indicate that life history traits generally possess lower heritabilities than morphological traits, and that the means, medians, and cumulative frequency distributions of behavioural and physiological traits are intermediate between life history and morphological traits. These findings are consistent with popular interpretations of Fisher's (1930, 1958) Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection, and Falconer (1960, 1981), but also indicate that high heritabilities are maintained within natural populations even for traits believed to be under strong selection. It is also found that the heritability of morphological traits is significantly lower for ectotherms than it is for endotherms which may in part be a result of the strong correlation between life history and body size for many ectotherms.},

abstract = {We mapped histone H3 lysine 4 di- and trimethylation and lysine 9/14 acetylation across the nonrepetitive portions of human chromosomes 21 and 22 and compared patterns of lysine 4 dimethylation for several orthologous human and mouse loci. Both chromosomes show punctate sites enriched for modified histones. Sites showing trimethylation correlate with transcription starts, while those showing mainly dimethylation occur elsewhere in the vicinity of active genes. Punctate methylation patterns are also evident at the cytokine and IL-4 receptor loci. The Hox clusters present a strikingly different picture, with broad lysine 4-methylated regions that overlay multiple active genes. We suggest these regions represent active chromatin domains required for the maintenance of Hox gene expression. Methylation patterns at orthologous loci are strongly conserved between human and mouse even though many methylated sites do not show sequence conservation notably higher than background. This suggests that the DNA elements that direct the methylation represent only a small fraction of the region or lie at some distance from the site.},

title = {Pattern of polymorphism after strong artificial selection in a domestication event},
abstract = {The process of strong artificial selection during a domestication event is modeled, and its effect on the pattern of DNA polymorphism is investigated. The model also considers population bottleneck during domestication. Artificial selection during domestication is different from a regular selective sweep because artificial selection acts on alleles that may have been neutral variants before domestication. Therefore, the fixation of such a beneficial allele does not always wipe out DNA variation in the surrounding region. The amount by which variation is reduced largely depends on the initial frequency of the beneficial allele, p. As a consequence, p has a strong effect on the likelihood of detecting the signature of selection during domestication from patterns of polymorphism. These theoretical results are discussed in light of data collected from maize. Although the main focus of this article is on domestication, this model can also be generalized to describe selective sweeps from standing genetic variation.},

Finally, we show that genes with similar functions tend to occur in adjacent positions along the chromosomes. Our results suggest that, in certain chromosomal expression domains, an UAS can affect the transcription of genes that are not immediately downstream from it.},

title = {Reliable and Global Measurement of Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Using Fluorescence Microscopes},
abstract = {Green fluorescence protein (GFP)-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is increasingly used in investigation of inter- and intramolecular interactions in living cells. In this report, we present a modified method for FRET quantification in cultured cells using conventional fluorescence microscopy. To reliably measure FRET, three positive control constructs in which a cyan fluorescence protein and a yellow fluorescence protein were linked by peptides of 15, 24, or 37 amino acid residues were prepared. FRET was detected using a spectrofluorometer, a laser scanning confocal microscope, and an inverted fluorescence microscope. Three calculation methods for FRET quantification using fluorescence microscopes were compared. By normalization against expression levels of GFP fusion proteins, the modified method gave consistent FRET values that could be compared among different cells with varying protein expression levels. Whole-cell global analysis using this method allowed FRET measurement with high spatial resolutions. Using such a procedure, the interaction of synaptic proteins syntaxin and the synaptosomal associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) was examined in PC12 cells, which showed strong FRET on plasma membranes. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the modified method for FRET measurement in live cell systems.},

title = {Epistasis in polygenic traits and the evolution of genetic architecture under stabilizing selection},
abstract = {We consider the effects of epistasis in a polygenic trait in the balance of mutation and stabilizing selection. The main issues are the genetic variation maintained in equilibrium and the evolution of the mutational effect distribution. The model assumes symmetric mutation and a continuum of alleles at all loci. Epistasis is modeled proportional to pairwise products of the single-locus effects. A general analytical formalism is developed. Assuming linkage equilibrium, we derive results for the equilibrium mutation load and the genetic and mutational variance in the house of cards and the Gaussian approximation. The additive genetic variation maintained in mutation-selection balance is reduced by any pattern of the epistatic interactions. The mutational variance, in contrast, is often increased. Large differences in mutational effects among loci emerge, and a negative correlation among (standard mean) locus mutation effects and mutation rates is predicted. Contrary to the common view since Waddington, we find that stabilizing selection in general does not lead to canalization of the trait. We propose that canalization as a target of selection instead occurs at the genic level. Here, primarily genes with a high mutation rate are buffered, often at the cost of decanalization of other genes. An intuitive interpretation of this view is given in the discussion.},

title = {Reliabilities of identifying positive selection by the branch-site and the site-prediction methods},
abstract = {Natural selection operating in protein-coding genes is often studied by examining the ratio (omega) of the rates of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution. The branch-site method (BSM) based on a likelihood ratio test is one of such tests to detect positive selection for a predetermined branch of a phylogenetic tree. However, because the number of nucleotide substitutions involved is often very small, we conducted a computer simulation to examine the reliability of BSM in comparison with the small-sample method (SSM) based on Fisher's exact test. The results indicate that BSM often generates false positives compared with SSM when the number of nucleotide substitutions is approximately 80 or smaller. Because the omega value is also used for predicting positively selected sites, we examined the reliabilities of the site-prediction methods, using nucleotide sequence data for the dim-light and color vision genes in vertebrates. The results showed that the site-prediction methods have a low probability of identifying functional changes of amino acids experimentally determined and often falsely identify other sites where amino acid substitutions are unlikely to be important. This low rate of predictability occurs because most of the current statistical methods are designed to identify codon sites with high omega values, which may not have anything to do with functional changes. The codon sites showing functional changes generally do not show a high omega value. To understand adaptive evolution, some form of experimental confirmation is necessary.},

A variety of recruitment techniques, including special assurance of confidentiality, were used to enroll participants. Nearly 5,000 homosexual men volunteered for semiannual interview, physical examination, and laboratory testing in four metropolitan areas. A significant majority of these men in each center (69-83%) reported having 50 or more lifetime sexual partners, and over 80% had engaged in receptive anal intercourse with at least some of their partners in the previous two years. By the time of the participants' initial evaluation (April 1984-April 1985), infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had occurred in higher proportions of men in Los Angeles (51%) and Chicago (43%) than in Baltimore/Washington, DC (31%) and Pittsburgh (21%), presumably as a result of the higher number of partners and proportion with whom these men had engaged in high-risk practices (e.g., receptive anal intercourse). Follow-up evaluations are underway in this comprehensive longitudinal investigation of HIV infection.},

Epistasis is the deviation of two-locus genotypic values from the sum of the contributing single-locus genotypic values. This parameterization leads to statistical tests for epistasis given estimates of two-locus genotypic values such as can be obtained from quantitative trait locus studies. The contributions of epistasis to the additive, dominance and interaction genetic variances are specified. Epistasis can make substantial contributions to each of these variance components. This parameterization of epistasis allows general consideration of the role of epistasis in evolution by defining its contribution to the additive genetic variance.},

title = {The Rate of Establishment of Complex Adaptations},
abstract = {A central problem in evolutionary theory concerns the mechanisms by which adaptations requiring multiple mutations emerge in natural populations. We develop a series of expressions that clarify the scaling of the time to establishment of complex adaptations with population size, mutation rate, magnitude of the selective disadvantage of intermediate-state alleles, and the complexity of the adaptation. In general, even in the face of deleterious intermediate steps, the time to establishment is minimized in populations with very large size. Under a broad range of conditions, the time to establishment also scales by no more than the square of the mutation rate, regardless of the number of sites contributing to the adaptive change, demonstrating that the emergence of complex adaptations is only weakly constrained by the independent acquisition of mutations at the underlying sites. Mutator alleles with deleterious side effects have only moderate effects on the rate of adaptation in large populations, but can cause a quantum decrease in the time to establishment of some adaptive alleles in small populations, although probably not at a high enough rate to offset the increased deleterious-mutation load. Transient hypermutability, whereby a subset of gamete-producing cells mutate at an elevated rate in a nonheritable manner, may also elevate the rate of adaptation, although the effect is modest and appears to result from a simple increase in the rate of transitions between intermediate states rather than from the saltational production of doublet mutations. Taken together, these results illustrate the plausibility of the relatively rapid emergence of specific complex adaptations by conventional population-genetic mechanisms, and provide insight into the relative incidences of various paths of allelic adaptation in organisms with different population-genetic features.},

title = {Protein stability imposes limits on organism complexity and speed of molecular evolution},
abstract = {Classical population genetics a priori assigns fitness to alleles without considering molecular or functional properties of proteins that these alleles encode. Here we study population dynamics in a model where fitness can be inferred from physical properties of proteins under a physiological assumption that loss of stability of any protein encoded by an essential gene confers a lethal phenotype. Accumulation of mutations in organisms containing Gamma genes can then be represented as diffusion within the Gamma-dimensional hypercube with adsorbing boundaries determined, in each dimension, by loss of a protein's stability and, at higher stability, by lack of protein sequences. Solving the diffusion equation whose parameters are derived from the data on point mutations in proteins, we determine a universal distribution of protein stabilities, in agreement with existing data. The theory provides a fundamental relation between mutation rate, maximal genome size, and thermodynamic response of proteins to point mutations. It establishes a universal speed limit on rate of molecular evolution by predicting that populations go extinct (via lethal mutagenesis) when mutation rate exceeds approximately six mutations per essential part of genome per replication for mesophilic organisms and one to two mutations per genome per replication for thermophilic ones. Several RNA viruses function close to the evolutionary speed limit, whereas error correction mechanisms used by DNA viruses and nonmutant strains of bacteria featuring various genome lengths and mutation rates have brought these organisms universally approximately 1,000-fold below the natural speed limit.},

Using a genome-wide approach, we assessed allele-specific transcription of about 4000 human genes in clonal cell lines and found that more than 300 were subject to random monoallelic expression. For a majority of monoallelic genes, we also observed some clonal lines displaying biallelic expression. Clonal cell lines reflect an independent choice to express the maternal, the paternal, or both alleles for each of these genes. This can lead to differences in expressed protein sequence and to differences in levels of gene expression. Unexpectedly widespread monoallelic expression suggests a mechanism that generates diversity in individual cells and their clonal descendants.},

An autologous and heterologous neutralizing antibody response has been documented using peripheral blood mononuclear cells- and GHOST(3) cell line-based assays. Viral evolution was investigated by env C2-V3 region sequence analysis. Although both siblings were infected with HIV-1 of the R5 phenotype, their viruses showed important biological differences. In the fast progressor there was a higher RANTES sensitivity of the early virus, an increased trend to change the mode of CCR5 receptor use, and a larger genetic evolution. Both children developed an autologous neutralizing antibody response starting from the second year with evidence of the continuous emergence of resistant variants. A marked viral genetic and phenotypic evolution was documented in the fast progressor sibling, which is accompanied by a high viral RANTES sensitivity and persistent neutralizing antibodies.},

Such linkages suggest a concept for engineering allosteric control into proteins: The intramolecular networks of two proteins could be joined across their surface sites such that the activity of one protein might control the activity of the other. We tested this idea by creating PAS-DHFR, a designed chimeric protein that connects a light-sensing signaling domain from a plant member of the Per/Arnt/Sim (PAS) family of proteins with Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). With no optimization, PAS-DHFR exhibited light-dependent catalytic activity that depended on the site of connection and on known signaling mechanisms in both proteins. PAS-DHFR serves as a proof of concept for engineering regulatory activities into proteins through interface design at conserved allosteric sites.},

title = {Polygenic variation maintained by balancing selection: pleiotropy, sex-dependent allelic effects and G x E interactions},
abstract = {We investigate three alternative selection-based scenarios proposed to maintain polygenic variation: pleiotropic balancing selection, G x E interactions (with spatial or temporal variation in allelic effects), and sex-dependent allelic effects. Each analysis assumes an additive polygenic trait with n diallelic loci under stabilizing selection. We allow loci to have different effects and consider equilibria at which the population mean departs from the stabilizing-selection optimum. Under weak selection, each model produces essentially identical, approximate allele-frequency dynamics. Variation is maintained under pleiotropic balancing selection only at loci for which the strength of balancing selection exceeds the effective strength of stabilizing selection. In addition, for all models, polymorphism requires that the population mean be close enough to the optimum that directional selection does not overwhelm balancing selection. This balance allows many simultaneously stable equilibria, and we explore their properties numerically. Both spatial and temporal G x E can maintain variation at loci for which the coefficient of variation (across environments) of the effect of a substitution exceeds a critical value greater than one. The critical value depends on the correlation between substitution effects at different loci. For large positive correlations (e.g., rho(ij)2>3/4), even extreme fluctuations in allelic effects cannot maintain variation. Surprisingly, this constraint on correlations implies that sex-dependent allelic effects cannot maintain polygenic variation. We present numerical results that support our analytical approximations and discuss our results in connection to relevant data and alternative variance-maintaining mechanisms.},

title = {Error thresholds for self- and cross-specific enzymatic replication},
abstract = { The information content of a non-enzymatic self-replicator is limited by Eigen's error threshold. Presumably, enzymatic replication can maintain higher complexity, but in a competitive environment such a replicator is faced with two problems related to its twofold role as enzyme and substrate: as enzyme, it should replicate itself rather than wastefully copy non-functional substrates, and as substrate it should preferably be replicated by superior enzymes instead of less-efficient mutants. Because specific recognition may provide a solution, we thoroughly analyze an idealized quasispecies model for enzymatic replication, with replication rates that are either a decreasing (self-specific) or increasing (cross-specific) function of the Hamming distance between the recognition or "tag" sequences of enzyme and substrate. We find that very weak self-specificity suffices to localize a population about a master sequence and thus to preserve its information, while simultaneous localization about complementary sequences in the cross-specific case is more challenging. A surprising result is that stronger specificity constraints allow longer recognition sequences, because the populations are better localized. Extrapolating from experimental data, we obtain rough quantitative estimates for the maximal length of the recognition or tag sequence that can be used to reliably discriminate appropriate and infeasible enzymes and substrates, respectively. },

title = {Sympatric speciation under incompatibility selection},
abstract = {The existing theory of sympatric speciation assumes that a local population splits into two species under one-dimensional disruptive selection, which favors both of the opposite extreme values of a quantitative trait. Here we model sympatric speciation under selection that favors high values of either of the two independently inherited traits, each required to efficiently consume one of the two available resources, but acts, because of a tradeoff, against those possessing high values of both traits. Such two-dimensional incompatibility selection is similar to that involved in allopatric speciation. Using a hypergeometric phenotypic model, we show that incompatibility selection readily leads to sympatric speciation. In contrast to disruptive selection, two distinct modes of sympatric speciation exist under incompatibility selection: under strong tradeoffs both of the new species are specialists, each consuming its own resource, but under moderate tradeoffs speciation may be asymmetric and involve the origin of a specialist and a generalist species. Also, incompatibility selection may lead to irreversible specialization: under strong tradeoffs, the population speciates if it consists mostly of unspecialized individuals, but remains undivided if most of the individuals are specialized to consume one of the resources. Incompatibility selection appears to be more realistic than disruptive selection, implying that incompatibility between individually adaptive alleles or trait states drives both allopatric and sympatric speciation.},

title = {DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SELECTION ON SEX VERSUS RECOMBINATION IN RED QUEEN MODELS WITH DIPLOID HOSTS},
abstract = {The Red Queen hypothesis argues that parasites generate selection for genetic mixing (sex and recombination) in their hosts. A number of recent papers have examined this hypothesis using models with haploid hosts. In these haploid models, sex and recombination are selectively equivalent. However, sex and recombination are not equivalent in diploids because selection on sex depends on the consequences of segregation as well as recombination. Here I compare how parasites select on modifiers of sexual reproduction and modifiers of recombination rate. Across a wide set of parameters, parasites tend to select against both sex and recombination, though recombination is favored more often than is sex. There is little correspondence between the conditions favoring sex and those favoring recombination, indicating that the direction of selection on sex is often determined by the effects of segregation, not recombination. Moreover, when sex was favored it is usually due to a long-term advantage whereas short-term effects are often responsible for selection favoring recombination. These results strongly indicate that Red Queen models focusing exclusively on the effects of recombination cannot be used to infer the type of selection on sex that is generated by parasites on diploid hosts.},

abstract = {Laboratory crosses were carried out among three genetically differentiated Los Angeles populations (all located within approximately 15 km) and one San Diego population (approximately 150 km away) of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus. Despite high levels of allozyme differentiation, all crosses produced viable F1 progeny. Most F1 progeny had shorter developmental times and reduced variance in developmental times compared to the parental populations. Only one pair of populations failed to produce viable F2 progeny; when the central Los Angeles population (AB) was crossed to the San Diego (SD) population, most larvae died during the late naupliar stages. Developmental times in the F2 generation of the other Los Angeles x San Diego crosses were typically 40% longer than developmental times of the parental populations. Among the Los Angeles populations, only one cross (and not its reciprocal) showed a similarly large increase in developmental time. Variance in F2 developmental times was greater than the parental variance in 5 of 10 crosses. These results are discussed with regard to the evolution of coadapted gene complexes and population differentiation in T. californicus.},

title = {Selection for recombination in small populations},
abstract = {The reasons that sex and recombination are so widespread remain elusive. One popular hypothesis is that sex and recombination promote adaptation to a changing environment. The strongest evidence that increased recombination may evolve because recombination promotes adaptation comes from artificially selected populations. Recombination rates have been found to increase as a correlated response to selection on traits unrelated to recombination in several artificial selection experiments and in a comparison of domesticated and nondomesticated mammals. There are, however, several alternative explanations for the increase in recombination in such populations, including two different evolutionary explanations. The first is that the form of selection is epistatic, generating linkage disequilibria among selected loci, which can indirectly favor modifier alleles that increase recombination. The second is that random genetic drift in selected populations tends to generate disequilibria such that beneficial alleles are often found in different individuals; modifier alleles that increase recombination can bring together such favorable alleles and thus may be found in individuals with greater fitness. In this paper, we compare the evolutionary forces acting on recombination in finite populations subject to strong selection. To our surprise, we found that drift accounted for the majority of selection for increased recombination observed in simulations of small to moderately large populations, suggesting that, unless selected populations are large, epistasis plays a secondary role in the evolution of recombination.},

title = {Recombination can evolve in large finite populations given selection on sufficient loci},
abstract = {It is well known that an allele causing increased recombination is expected to proliferate as a result of genetic drift in a finite population undergoing selection, without requiring other mechanisms. This is supported by recent simulations apparently demonstrating that, in small populations, drift is more important than epistasis in increasing recombination, with this effect disappearing in larger finite populations. However, recent experimental evidence finds a greater advantage for recombination in larger populations. These results are reconciled by demonstrating through simulation without epistasis that for m loci recombination has an appreciable selective advantage over a range of population sizes (am, bm). bm increases steadily with m while am remains fairly static. Thus, however large the finite population, if selection acts on sufficiently many loci, an allele that increases recombination is selected for. We show that as selection acts on our finite population, recombination increases the variance in expected log fitness, causing indirect selection on a recombination-modifying locus. This effect is enhanced in those populations with more loci because the variance in phenotypic fitnesses in relation to the possible range will be smaller. Thus fixation of a particular haplotype is less likely to occur, increasing the advantage of recombination.},

abstract = {Upon HIV transmission, some patients develop AIDS in only a few months, while others remain disease free for 20 or more years. This variation in the rate of disease progression is poorly understood and has been attributed to host genetics, host immune responses, co-infection, viral genetics, and adaptation. Here, we develop a new "relaxed-clock" phylogenetic method to estimate absolute rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution through time. We identify an unexpected association between the synonymous substitution rate of HIV and disease progression parameters. Since immune activation is the major determinant of HIV disease progression, we propose that this process can also determine viral generation times, by creating favourable conditions for HIV replication. These conclusions may apply more generally to HIV evolution, since we also observed an overall low synonymous substitution rate for HIV-2, which is known to be less pathogenic than HIV-1 and capable of tempering the detrimental effects of immune activation. Humoral immune responses, on the other hand, are the major determinant of nonsynonymous rate changes through time in the envelope gene, and our relaxed-clock estimates support a decrease in selective pressure as a consequence of immune system collapse.},

title = {Mutation load and rapid adaptation favour outcrossing over self-fertilization},
abstract = {The tendency of organisms to reproduce by cross-fertilization despite numerous disadvantages relative to self-fertilization is one of the oldest puzzles in evolutionary biology. For many species, the primary obstacle to the evolution of outcrossing is the cost of production of males, individuals that do not directly contribute offspring and thus diminish the long-term reproductive output of a lineage. Self-fertilizing ('selfing') organisms do not incur the cost of males and therefore should possess at least a twofold numerical advantage over most outcrossing organisms. Two competing explanations for the widespread prevalence of outcrossing in nature despite this inherent disadvantage are the avoidance of inbreeding depression generated by selfing and the ability of outcrossing populations to adapt more rapidly to environmental change. Here we show that outcrossing is favoured in populations of Caenorhabditis elegans subject to experimental evolution both under conditions of increased mutation rate and during adaptation to a novel environment. In general, fitness increased with increasing rates of outcrossing. Thus, each of the standard explanations for the maintenance of outcrossing are correct, and it is likely that outcrossing is the predominant mode of reproduction in most species because it is favoured under ecological conditions that are ubiquitous in natural environments.},

abstract = {Drug resistance is a major obstacle to the successful treatment of HIV-1 infection. Genotypic assays are used widely to provide indirect evidence of drug resistance, but the performance of these assays has been mixed. We used standard stepwise linear regression to construct drug resistance models for seven protease inhibitors and 10 reverse transcriptase inhibitors using data obtained from the Stanford HIV drug resistance database. We evaluated these models by hold-one-out experiments and by tests on an independent dataset. Our linear model outperformed other publicly available genotypic interpretation algorithms, including decision tree, support vector machine and four rules-based algorithms (HIVdb, VGI, ANRS and Rega) under both tests. Interestingly, our model did well despite the absence of any terms for interactions between different residues in protease or reverse transcriptase. The resulting linear models are easy to understand and can potentially assist in choosing combination therapy regimens.},

abstract = {The myc gene family encodes a group of transcription factors that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. These genes are widely studied because of their importance as proto-oncogenes. Phylogenetic analyses are described here for 45 Myc protein sequences representing c-, N-, L-, S-, and B-myc genes. A gene duplication early in vertebrate evolution produced the c-myc lineage and another lineage that later gave rise to the N- and L-myc lineages by another gene duplication. Evolutionary divergence in the myc gene family corresponds closely to the known branching order of the major vertebrate groups. The patterns of sequence evolution are described for five separate highly conserved regions, and these analyses show that differential rates of sequence divergence (= mosaic evolution) have occurred among conserved motifs. Further, the closely related dimerization partner protein Max exhibits significantly less sequence variability than Myc. It is suggested that the reduced variability in max stems from natural selection acting to preserve dimerization capability with products of myc and related genes.},

We have developed an optical tweezers assay to follow individual Pol II complexes as they transcribe nucleosomal DNA. Our results indicate that the nucleosome behaves as a fluctuating barrier that locally increases pause density, slows pause recovery, and reduces the apparent pause-free velocity of Pol II. The polymerase, rather than actively separating DNA from histones, functions instead as a ratchet that rectifies nucleosomal fluctuations. We also obtained direct evidence that transcription through a nucleosome involves transfer of the core histones behind the transcribing polymerase via a transient DNA loop. The interplay between polymerase dynamics and nucleosome fluctuations provides a physical basis for the regulation of eukaryotic transcription.},

abstract = {Lateral gene transfer from prokaryotes to animals is poorly understood, and the scarce documented examples generally concern genes of uncharacterized role in the receiver organism. In contrast, in plant-parasitic nematodes, several genes, usually not found in animals and similar to bacterial homologs, play essential roles for successful parasitism. Many of these encode plant cell wall-degrading enzymes that constitute an unprecedented arsenal in animals in terms of both abundance and diversity. Here we report that independent lateral gene transfers from different bacteria, followed by gene duplications and early gain of introns, have shaped this repertoire. We also show protein immunolocalization data that suggest additional roles for some of these cell wall-degrading enzymes in the late stages of these parasites' life cycle. Multiple functional acquisitions of exogenous genes that provide selective advantage were probably crucial for the emergence and proficiency of plant parasitism in nematodes.},

abstract = {The hypothesis that folding robustness is the primary determinant of the evolution rate of proteins is explored using a coarse-grained off-lattice model. The simplicity of the model allows rapid computation of the folding probability of a sequence to any folded conformation. For each robust folder, the network of sequences that share its native structure is identified. The fitness of a sequence is postulated to be a simple function of the number of misfolded molecules that have to be produced to reach a characteristic protein abundance. After fixation probabilities of mutants are computed under a simple population dynamics model, a Markov chain on the fold network is constructed, and the fold-averaged evolution rate is computed. The distribution of the logarithm of the evolution rates across distinct networks exhibits a peak with a long tail on the low rate side and resembles the universal empirical distribution of the evolutionary rates more closely than either distribution resembles the log-normal distribution. The results suggest that the universal distribution of the evolutionary rates of protein-coding genes is a direct consequence of the basic physics of protein folding.},

title = {An evolutionary-network model reveals stratified interactions in the V3 loop of the HIV-1 envelope},
abstract = {The third variable loop (V3) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope is a principal determinant of antibody neutralization and progression to AIDS. Although it is undoubtedly an important target for vaccine research, extensive genetic variation in V3 remains an obstacle to the development of an effective vaccine. Comparative methods that exploit the abundance of sequence data can detect interactions between residues of rapidly evolving proteins such as the HIV-1 envelope, revealing biological constraints on their variability. However, previous studies have relied implicitly on two biologically unrealistic assumptions: (1) that founder effects in the evolutionary history of the sequences can be ignored, and; (2) that statistical associations between residues occur exclusively in pairs. We show that comparative methods that neglect the evolutionary history of extant sequences are susceptible to a high rate of false positives (20%-40%). Therefore, we propose a new method to detect interactions that relaxes both of these assumptions. First, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of extant sequences by maximum likelihood, shifting focus from extant sequence variation to the underlying substitution events. Second, we analyze the joint distribution of substitution events among positions in the sequence as a Bayesian graphical model, in which each branch in the phylogeny is a unit of observation. We perform extensive validation of our models using both simulations and a control case of known interactions in HIV-1 protease, and apply this method to detect interactions within V3 from a sample of 1,154 HIV-1 envelope sequences. Our method greatly reduces the number of false positives due to founder effects, while capturing several higher-order interactions among V3 residues. By mapping these interactions to a structural model of the V3 loop, we find that the loop is stratified into distinct evolutionary clusters. We extend our model to detect interactions between the V3 and C4 domains of the HIV-1 envelope, and account for the uncertainty in mapping substitutions to the tree with a parametric bootstrap.},

Against this background, the genomes of all species are remarkably conserved, not only in transcribed sequences, but also in some chromosome-specific non-coding sequences and in gene order. A close examination with chromosome painting shows that this conservation can be resolved into small numbers of large chromosomal segments. Rearrangement of these segments into different combinations explains much of the observed diversity in species karyotypes. Here we discuss how these rearrangements come about, and show how their analysis can determine the evolutionary relationships of all mammals and their descent from a common ancestor.},

title = {Evolution of genetic variability and the advantage of sex and recombination in changing environments},
abstract = {The role of recombination and sexual reproduction in enhancing adaptation and population persistence in temporally varying environments is investigated on the basis of a quantitative-genetic multilocus model. Populations are finite, subject to density-dependent regulation with a finite growth rate, diploid, and either asexual or randomly mating and sexual with or without recombination. A quantitative trait is determined by a finite number of loci at which mutation generates genetic variability. The trait is under stabilizing selection with an optimum that either changes at a constant rate in one direction, exhibits periodic cycling, or fluctuates randomly. It is shown by Monte Carlo simulations that if the directional-selection component prevails, then freely recombining populations gain a substantial evolutionary advantage over nonrecombining and asexual populations that goes far beyond that recognized in previous studies. The reason is that in such populations, the genetic variance can increase substantially and thus enhance the rate of adaptation. In nonrecombining and asexual populations, no or much less increase of variance occurs. It is explored by simulation and mathematical analysis when, why, and by how much genetic variance increases in response to environmental change. In particular, it is elucidated how this change in genetic variance depends on the reproductive system, the population size, and the selective regime, and what the consequences for population persistence are.},

title = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based stoichiometry in living cells},
abstract = {Imaging of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescently labeled molecules can measure the timing and location of intermolecular interactions inside living cells. Present microscopic methods measure FRET in arbitrary units, and cannot discriminate FRET efficiency and the fractions of donor and acceptor in complex. Here we describe a stoichiometric method that uses three microscopic fluorescence images to measure FRET efficiency, the relative concentrations of donor and acceptor, and the fractions of donor and acceptor in complex in living cells. FRET stoichiometry derives from the concept that specific donor-acceptor complexes will give rise to a characteristic FRET efficiency, which, if measured, can allow stoichiometric discrimination of interacting components. A first equation determines FRET efficiency and the fraction of acceptor molecules in complex with donor. A second equation determines the fraction of donor molecules in complex by estimating the donor fluorescence lost due to energy transfer. This eliminates the need for acceptor photobleaching to determine total donor concentrations and allows for repeated measurements from the same cell. A third equation obtains the ratio of total acceptor to total donor molecules. The theory and method were confirmed by microscopic measurements of fluorescence from cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), citrine, and linked CFP-Citrine fusion protein, in solutions and inside cells. Together, the methods derived from these equations allow sensitive, rapid, and repeatable detection of donor-, acceptor-, and donor-acceptor complex stoichiometry at each pixel in an image. By accurately imaging molecular interactions, FRET stoichiometry opens new areas for quantitative study of intracellular molecular networks.},

We investigate the efficiency of various frequency-domain lifetime detection techniques also in relation to time-domain detection. Nonlinear effects are discussed that are introduced by the use of image intensifiers and by fluorophore saturation. The efficiency of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy setups is connected to the speed of acquisition and thus to the imaging throughput. We report on the optimal conditions for balancing signal-to-noise ratio and acquisition speed in fluorescence lifetime sensing.},

title = {Genetic regulation of leishmanial and mycobacterial infections: the Lsh/Ity/Bcg gene story continues},
abstract = {A common basis to genetic regulation of leishmanial and mycobacterial infections is provided by the action of the murine Lsh/Ity/Bcg gene in controlling the priming/activation of macrophages for antimicrobial activity. This relies on the TNF-alpha-dependent sustained expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene responsible for the generation of large amounts of toxic nitric oxide (NO). The Lsh/Ity/Bcg gene has many pleiotropic effects, including differential expression of the early response gene KC following stimulation of macrophages with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan (LAM). The major signal transduction pathway involved in KC induction requires the generation of low levels of NO via constitutive nitric oxide synthase (cNOS) activity, leading to activation of guanylate cyclase and the cGMP-dependent kinase pathway. NO therefore appears to provide a common link between the early influence of Lsh in regulating the expression of genes which mediate many pleiotropic effects, and the later production of NO as the final effector mechanism for kill. The recently cloned candidate for Lsh/Ity/Bcg, designated Nramp for Natural resistance associated macrophage protein, encodes a polytopic integral membrane protein that has structural features common to prokaryotic and eukaryotic transporters and includes a conserved binding-protein-dependent transport motif which may be involved in interaction with peripheral ATP-binding subunits. The N-terminal sequence also carries a proline/serine rich putative SH3 binding domain, consistent with a role for tyrosine kinases in regulating Nramp function. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

title = {A case study of evolutionary computation of biochemical adaptation},
abstract = {Simulations of evolution have a long history, but their relation to biology is questioned because of the perceived contingency of evolution. Here we provide an example of a biological process, adaptation, where simulations are argued to approach closer to biology. Adaptation is a common feature of sensory systems, and a plausible component of other biochemical networks because it rescales upstream signals to facilitate downstream processing. We create random gene networks numerically, by linking genes with interactions that model transcription, phosphorylation and protein-protein association. We define a fitness function for adaptation in terms of two functional metrics, and show that any reasonable combination of them will yield the same adaptive networks after repeated rounds of mutation and selection. Convergence to these networks is driven by positive selection and thus fast. There is always a path in parameter space of continuously improving fitness that leads to perfect adaptation, implying that the actual mutation rates we use in the simulation do not bias the results. Our results imply a kinetic view of evolution, i.e., it favors gene networks that can be learned quickly from the random examples supplied by mutation. This formulation allows for deductive predictions of the networks realized in nature.},

We mapped several loci, some containing large, inherited, homozygous deletions that are likely mutations. The largest deletions implicated genes, including PCDH10 (protocadherin 10) and DIA1 (deleted in autism1, or c3orf58), whose level of expression changes in response to neuronal activity, a marker of genes involved in synaptic changes that underlie learning. A subset of genes, including NHE9 (Na+/H+ exchanger 9), showed additional potential mutations in patients with unrelated parents. Our findings highlight the utility of "homozygosity mapping" in heterogeneous disorders like autism but also suggest that defective regulation of gene expression after neural activity may be a mechanism common to seemingly diverse autism mutations.},

We investigated the role of the S locus in the evolution of and transition to selfing in A. thaliana. We found that the S locus of A. thaliana harbored considerable diversity, which is an apparent remnant of polymorphism in the outcrossing ancestor. Thus, the fixation of a single inactivated S-locus allele cannot have been a key step in the transition to selfing. An analysis of the genome-wide pattern of linkage disequilibrium suggests that selfing most likely evolved roughly a million years ago or more.},

To delineate the "landscape" of somatic mutation in a human epithelial cell lineage, we determined the frequency and molecular nature of somatic mutations occurring in vivo in the X-linked HPRT gene of kidney tubular epithelial cells. Kidney epithelial mutants were frequent (range 0.5 to 4.2 x 10(-4)) and contained a high proportion of unreported HPRT base substitutions, -1-bp deletions and multiple mutations. This spectrum of somatic mutation differed from HPRT mutations identified in human peripheral blood T lymphocytes and from germ-line HPRT mutations identified in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or hyperuricemia patients. Our results indicate that DNA damage and mutagenesis may have unusual or mechanistically interesting features in kidney tubular epithelium, and that somatic mutation may play a more important role in human kidney disease than has been previously appreciated.},

abstract = {The considerable range of observed phenotypic variation in human populations may reflect, in part, distinctive processes of natural selection and adaptation to variable environmental conditions. Although recent genome-wide studies have identified candidate regions under selection, it is not yet clear how natural selection has shaped population differentiation. Here, we have analyzed the degree of population differentiation at 2.8 million Phase II HapMap single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We find that negative selection has globally reduced population differentiation at amino acid-altering mutations, particularly in disease-related genes. Conversely, positive selection has ensured the regional adaptation of human populations by increasing population differentiation in gene regions, primarily at nonsynonymous and 5'-UTR variants. Our analyses identify a fraction of loci that have contributed, and probably still contribute, to the morphological and disease-related phenotypic diversity of current human populations.},

I review what is known about the number of genes involved in such differences, as well as about the role of major genes and epistasis in the evolution of these differences. I also compare and contrast these findings with those on the genetics of reproductive isolation.},

title = {Rate of Adaptation in Large Sexual Populations},
abstract = {Adaptation often involves the acquisition of a large number of genomic changes which arise as mutations in single individuals. In asexual populations, combinations of mutations can fix only when they arise in the same lineage, but for populations in which genetic information is exchanged, beneficial mutations can arise in different individuals and be combined later. In large populations, when the product of the population size N and the total beneficial mutation rate Ub is large, many new beneficial alleles can be segregating in the population simultaneously. We calculate the rate of adaptation, v, in several models of such sexual populations and show that v is linear in Nb only in sufficiently small populations. In large populations, v increases much more slowly as logNUb. The prefactor of this logarithm, however, increases as the square of the recombination rate. This acceleration of adaptation by recombination implies a strong evolutionary advantage of sex.},

abstract = { Major efforts to sequence cancer genomes are now occurring throughout the world. Though the emerging data from these studies are illuminating, their reconciliation with epidemiologic and clinical observations poses a major challenge. In the current study, we provide a novel mathematical model that begins to address this challenge. We model tumors as a discrete time branching process that starts with a single driver mutation and proceeds as each new driver mutation leads to a slightly increased rate of clonal expansion. Using the model, we observe tremendous variation in the rate of tumor development - providing an understanding of the heterogeneity in tumor sizes and development times that have been observed by epidemiologists and clinicians. Furthermore, the model provides a simple formula for the number of driver mutations as a function of the total number of mutations in the tumor. Finally, when applied to recent experimental data, the model allows us to calculate, for the first time, the actual selective advantage provided by typical somatic mutations in human tumors in situ. This selective advantage is surprisingly small, 0.005 +- 0.0005, and has major implications for experimental cancer research. },

title = {Non-random clustering of stress-related genes during evolution of the S. cerevisiae genome},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coordinately regulated genes often physically cluster in eukaryotic genomes, for reasons that remain unclear. RESULTS: Here we provide evidence that many S. cerevisiae genes induced by starvation and other stresses reside in non-random clusters, where transcription of these genes is repressed in the absence of stress. Most genes essential for growth or for rapid, post-transcriptional responses to stress in cycling cells map between these gene clusters. Genes that are transcriptionally induced by stresses include a large fraction of rapidly evolving paralogues of duplicated genes that arose during an ancient whole genome duplication event. Many of these rapidly evolving paralogues have acquired new or more specialized functions that are less essential for growth. The slowly evolving paralogues of these genes are less likely to be transcriptionally repressed in the absence of stress, and are frequently essential for growth or for rapid stress responses that may require constitutive expression of these genes in cycling cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that a fundamental organizing principle during evolution of the S. cerevisiae genome has been clustering of starvation and other stress-induced genes in chromosome regions that are transcriptionally repressed in the absence of stress, from which most genes essential for growth or rapid stress responses have been excluded. Chromatin-mediated repression of many stress-induced genes may have evolved since the whole genome duplication in parallel with functions for proteins encoded by these genes that are incompatible with growth. These functions likely provide fitness effects that escape detection in assays of reproductive capacity routinely employed to assess evolutionary fitness, or to identify genes that confer stress-resistance in cycling cells.},

Comparing the sequences of individual genes from a variety of organisms has revolutionized our understanding of how single genes evolve, but the challenge of analyzing polygenic phenotypes has complicated efforts to study how genes evolve when they are part of a group that functions collectively. We suggest that biosynthetic gene clusters from microbes are ideal candidates for the evolutionary study of gene collectives; these selfish genetic elements evolve rapidly, they usually comprise a complete pathway, and they have a phenotype-a small molecule-that is easy to identify and assay. Because these elements are transferred horizontally as well as vertically, they also provide an opportunity to study the effects of horizontal transmission on gene evolution. We discuss known examples to begin addressing two fundamental questions about the evolution of biosynthetic gene clusters: How do they propagate by horizontal transfer? How do they change to create new molecules?},

title = {Population genetic variation in gene expression is associated with phenotypic variation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between genetic variation in gene expression and phenotypic variation observable in nature is not well understood. Identifying how many phenotypes are associated with differences in gene expression and how many gene-expression differences are associated with a phenotype is important to understanding the molecular basis and evolution of complex traits. RESULTS: We compared levels of gene expression among nine natural isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown either in the presence or absence of copper sulfate. Of the nine strains, two show a reduced growth rate and two others are rust colored in the presence of copper sulfate. We identified 633 genes that show significant differences in expression among strains. Of these genes, 20 were correlated with resistance to copper sulfate and 24 were correlated with rust coloration. The function of these genes in combination with their expression pattern suggests the presence of both correlative and causative expression differences. But the majority of differentially expressed genes were not correlated with either phenotype and showed the same expression pattern both in the presence and absence of copper sulfate. To determine whether these expression differences may contribute to phenotypic variation under other environmental conditions, we examined one phenotype, freeze tolerance, predicted by the differential expression of the aquaporin gene AQY2. We found freeze tolerance is associated with the expression of AQY2. CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression differences provide substantial insight into the molecular basis of naturally occurring traits and can be used to predict environment dependent phenotypic variation.},

title = {Evolution of robustness in the signaling network of Pristionchus vulva development},
abstract = {Robustness to environmental or genetic perturbation, like any other trait, is affected by evolutionary change. However, direct studies on the interplay of robustness and evolvability are limited and require experimental microevolutionary studies of developmental processes. One system in which such microevolutionary studies can be performed is vulva development in the nematode Pristionchus pacificus. Three vulval precursor cells respond to redundant cell-cell interactions, including signals from the gonad and the epidermal cell P8.p. Interestingly, P. pacificus P8.p is involved in cell fate specification of the future vulva cells by lateral inhibition but is incompetent to respond to the inductive signal from the gonad itself. These functional properties of P8.p are unknown from other nematodes, such as Caenorhabditis elegans. We began an experimental and genetic analysis of the microevolution of P8.p function. We show that vulva misspecification events differ between Pristionchus strains and species. Similarly, lateral inhibition and developmental competence of P8.p evolved within the genus Pristionchus and between natural isolates of P. pacificus. Surprisingly, in some recombinant inbred lines of two distinct P. pacificus isolates, P8.p gained competence to form vulva tissue, a trait that was never observed in P. pacificus isolates. Our results suggest differences in developmental stability between natural isolates, and we hypothesize that the remarkable evolvability of redundant cell-cell interactions allows for adaptive evolution of robustness to developmental noise.},

title = {The solitary wave of asexual evolution},
abstract = {Using a previously undescribed approach, we develop an analytic model that predicts whether an asexual population accumulates advantageous or deleterious mutations over time and the rate at which either process occurs. The model considers a large number of linked identical loci, or nucleotide sites; assumes that the selection coefficient per site is much less than the mutation rate per genome; and includes back and compensating mutations. Using analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate the accuracy of our results over almost the entire range of population sizes. Two limiting cases of our results, when either deleterious or advantageous mutations can be neglected, correspond to the Fisher-Muller effect and Muller's ratchet, respectively. By comparing predictions of our model (no recombination) to those of simple single-locus models (strong recombination), we show that the accumulation of advantageous mutations is slowed by linkage over a broad, finite range of population size. This supports the view of Fisher and Muller, who argued in the 1930s that progressive evolution of organisms is slowed because loci at which beneficial mutations can occur are often linked together on the same chromosome. These results follow from our main finding, that distribution of sequences over the mutation number evolves as a traveling wave whose speed and width depend on population size and other parameters. The model explains a logarithmic dependence of steady-state fitness on the population size reported recently for an RNA virus.},

Here we develop an evolutionarily grounded method for the cross-species analysis of interaction networks by alignment, which maps bona fide functional relationships between genes in different organisms. Network alignment is based on a scoring function measuring mutual similarities between networks, taking into account their interaction patterns as well as sequence similarities between their nodes. High-scoring alignments and optimal alignment parameters are inferred by a systematic Bayesian analysis. We apply this method to analyze the evolution of coexpression networks between humans and mice. We find evidence for significant conservation of gene expression clusters and give network-based predictions of gene function. We discuss examples where cross-species functional relationships between genes do not concur with sequence similarity.},

title = {Local graph alignment and motif search in biological networks},
abstract = {Interaction networks are of central importance in postgenomic molecular biology, with increasing amounts of data becoming available by high-throughput methods. Examples are gene regulatory networks or protein interaction maps. The main challenge in the analysis of these data is to read off biological functions from the topology of the network. Topological motifs, i.e., patterns occurring repeatedly at different positions in the network, have recently been identified as basic modules of molecular information processing. In this article, we discuss motifs derived from families of mutually similar but not necessarily identical patterns. We establish a statistical model for the occurrence of such motifs, from which we derive a scoring function for their statistical significance. Based on this scoring function, we develop a search algorithm for topological motifs called graph alignment, a procedure with some analogies to sequence alignment. The algorithm is applied to the gene regulation network of Escherichia coli.},

title = {Evolution of digital organisms at high mutation rates leads to survival of the flattest},
abstract = {Darwinian evolution favours genotypes with high replication rates, a process called 'survival of the fittest'. However, knowing the replication rate of each individual genotype may not suffice to predict the eventual survivor, even in an asexual population. According to quasi-species theory, selection favours the cloud of genotypes, interconnected by mutation, whose average replication rate is highest. Here we confirm this prediction using digital organisms that self-replicate, mutate and evolve. Forty pairs of populations were derived from 40 different ancestors in identical selective environments, except that one of each pair experienced a 4-fold higher mutation rate. In 12 cases, the dominant genotype that evolved at the lower mutation rate achieved a replication rate >1.5-fold faster than its counterpart. We allowed each of these disparate pairs to compete across a range of mutation rates. In each case, as mutation rate was increased, the outcome of competition switched to favour the genotype with the lower replication rate. These genotypes, although they occupied lower fitness peaks, were located in flatter regions of the fitness surface and were therefore more robust with respect to mutations.},

title = {Evidence for domesticated and wild populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae},
abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae is predominantly found in association with human activities, particularly the production of alcoholic beverages. S. paradoxus, the closest known relative of S. cerevisiae, is commonly found on exudates and bark of deciduous trees and in associated soils. This has lead to the idea that S. cerevisiae is a domesticated species, specialized for the fermentation of alcoholic beverages, and isolates of S. cerevisiae from other sources simply represent migrants from these fermentations. We have surveyed DNA sequence diversity at five loci in 81 strains of S. cerevisiae that were isolated from a variety of human and natural fermentations as well as sources unrelated to alcoholic beverage production, such as tree exudates and immunocompromised patients. Diversity within vineyard strains and within sak{\'e} strains is low, consistent with their status as domesticated stocks. The oldest lineages and the majority of variation are found in strains from sources unrelated to wine production. We propose a model whereby two specialized breeds of S. cerevisiae have been created, one for the production of grape wine and one for the production of sak{\'e} wine. We estimate that these two breeds have remained isolated from one another for thousands of years, consistent with the earliest archeological evidence for wine-making. We conclude that although there are clearly strains of S. cerevisiae specialized for the production of alcoholic beverages, these have been derived from natural populations unassociated with alcoholic beverage production, rather than the opposite.},

title = {Quantitative test of the barrier nucleosome model for statistical positioning of nucleosomes up- and downstream of transcription start sites},
abstract = {The positions of nucleosomes in eukaryotic genomes determine which parts of the DNA sequence are readily accessible for regulatory proteins and which are not. Genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions have revealed a salient pattern around transcription start sites, involving a nucleosome-free region (NFR) flanked by a pronounced periodic pattern in the average nucleosome density. While the periodic pattern clearly reflects well-positioned nucleosomes, the positioning mechanism is less clear. A recent experimental study by Mavrich et al. argued that the pattern observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is qualitatively consistent with a "barrier nucleosome model," in which the oscillatory pattern is created by the statistical positioning mechanism of Kornberg and Stryer. On the other hand, there is clear evidence for intrinsic sequence preferences of nucleosomes, and it is unclear to what extent these sequence preferences affect the observed pattern. To test the barrier nucleosome model, we quantitatively analyze yeast nucleosome positioning data both up- and downstream from NFRs. Our analysis is based on the Tonks model of statistical physics which quantifies the interplay between the excluded-volume interaction of nucleosomes and their positional entropy. We find that although the typical patterns on the two sides of the NFR are different, they are both quantitatively described by the same physical model with the same parameters, but different boundary conditions. The inferred boundary conditions suggest that the first nucleosome downstream from the NFR (the +1 nucleosome) is typically directly positioned while the first nucleosome upstream is statistically positioned via a nucleosome-repelling DNA region. These boundary conditions, which can be locally encoded into the genome sequence, significantly shape the statistical distribution of nucleosomes over a range of up to approximately 1,000 bp to each side.},

abstract = {An infinite-site neutral allele model with crossing-over possible at any of an infinite number of sites is studied. A formula for the variance of the number of segregating sites in a sample of gametes is obtained. An approximate expression for the expected homozygosity is also derived. Simulation results are presented to indicate the accuracy of the approximations. The results concerning the number of segregating sites and the expected homozygosity indicate that a two-locus model and the infinite-site model behave similarly for 4Nu less than or equal to 2 and r less than or equal to 5u, where N is the population size, u is the neutral mutation rate, and r is the recombination rate. Simulations of a two-locus model and a four-locus model were also carried out to determine the effect of intragenic recombination on the homozygosity test of Watterson (Genetics 85, 789-814; 88, 405-417) and on the number of unique alleles in a sample. The results indicate that for 4Nu less than or equal to 2 and r less than or equal to 10u, the effect of recombination is quite small.},

title = {Epistasis among HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DQB1 loci determines multiple sclerosis susceptibility},
abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS), a common central nervous system inflammatory disease, has a major heritable component. Susceptibility is associated with the MHC class II region, especially HLA-DRB5*0101-HLA-DRB1*1501-HLA-DQA1*0102-HLA-DQB1*0602 haplotypes (hereafter DR2), which dominate genetic contribution to MS risk. Marked linkage disequilibrium (LD) among these loci makes identification of a specific locus difficult. The once-leading candidate, HLA-DRB1*15, localizes to risk, neutral, and protective haplotypes. HLA-DRB1*15 and HLA-DQB1*0602, nearly always located together on a small ancestral chromosome segment, are strongly MS-associated. One intervening allele on this haplotype, viz. HLA-DQA1*0102, shows no primary MS association. Two Canadian cohorts (n = 830 and n = 438 trios) genotyped for HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 alleles were tested for association using TDT. To evaluate epistasis involving HLA-DRB1*15, transmissions from HLA-DRB1*15-negative parents were stratified by the presence/absence of HLA-DRB1*15 in affected offspring. All 3 alleles contribute to MS susceptibility through novel epistatic interactions. HLA-DQA1*0102 increased disease risk when combined with HLA-DRB1*1501 in trans, thereby unambiguously implicating HLA-DQ in MS susceptibility. Three-locus haplotypes demonstrated that HLA-DRB1*1501 and HLA-DQB1*0602 each influence risk. Transmissions of rare morcellated DR2 haplotypes showed no interaction with HLA-DQA1*0102. Incomplete haplotypes bearing only HLA-DRB1*1501 or HLA-DQB1*0602 did not predispose to MS. Balanced reciprocal transmission distortion can mask epistatic allelic association. These findings implicate epistasis among HLA class II alleles in human immune responses generally, provide partial explanation for intense linkage disequilibrium in the MHC, have relevance to animal models, and demonstrate key roles for DR2-specific interactions in MS susceptibility. MHC disease associations may be more generally haplotypic or diplotypic.},

title = {Prediction of co-receptor usage of HIV-1 from genotype},
abstract = {Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 uses for entry into host cells a receptor (CD4) and one of two co-receptors (CCR5 or CXCR4). Recently, a new class of antiretroviral drugs has entered clinical practice that specifically bind to the co-receptor CCR5, and thus inhibit virus entry. Accurate prediction of the co-receptor used by the virus in the patient is important as it allows for personalized selection of effective drugs and prognosis of disease progression. We have investigated whether it is possible to predict co-receptor usage accurately by analyzing the amino acid sequence of the main determinant of co-receptor usage, i.e., the third variable loop V3 of the gp120 protein. We developed a two-level machine learning approach that in the first level considers two different properties important for protein-protein binding derived from structural models of V3 and V3 sequences. The second level combines the two predictions of the first level. The two-level method predicts usage of CXCR4 co-receptor for new V3 sequences within seconds, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.937+/-0.004. Moreover, it is relatively robust against insertions and deletions, which frequently occur in V3. The approach could help clinicians to find optimal personalized treatments, and it offers new insights into the molecular basis of co-receptor usage. For instance, it quantifies the importance for co-receptor usage of a pocket that probably is responsible for binding sulfated tyrosine.},

title = {Solenoidal Model for Superstructure in Chromatin},
abstract = {Chromatin prepared by brief digestion of nuclei with micrococcal nuclease, and extracted in 0.2 mM EDTA, appears in the electron microscope as filaments of about 100 angstrom diameter which coil loosely. In 0.2 mM Mg++ these ``nucleofilaments'' condense into a supercoil or solenoidal structure of pitch about 110 angstrom corresponding to the diameter of a nucleofilament. It is proposed that the x-ray reflections at orders of 110 angstrom observed in chromatin originate in the spacing between turns of the solenoid rather than that between nucleosomes along the nucleofilament. The solenoidal structure appears to need histone H1 for its stabilization. Under certain conditions, isolated nucleosomes can also aggregate into a similar structure. The solenoidal structure can be correlated with the ``thread'' of diameter about 300 angstrom observed by other workers in nuclei.},

abstract = {High-throughput genomic sequencing has focused attention on understanding differences between species and between individuals. When this genetic variation affects protein sequences, the rate of amino acid substitution reflects both Darwinian selection for functionally advantageous mutations and selectively neutral evolution operating within the constraints of structure and function. During neutral evolution, whereby mutations accumulate by random drift, amino acid substitutions are constrained by factors such as the formation of intramolecular and intermolecular interactions and the accessibility to water or lipids surrounding the protein. These constraints arise from the need to conserve a specific architecture and to retain interactions that mediate functions in protein families and superfamilies.},

title = {Elastic Lever-Arm Model for Myosin V},
abstract = {We present a mechanochemical model for myosin V, a two-headed processive motor protein. We derive the properties of a dimer from those of an individual head, which we model both with a four-state cycle (detached; attached with ADP.Pi; attached with ADP; and attached without nucleotide) and alternatively with a five-state cycle (where the powerstroke is not tightly coupled to the phosphate release). In each state the lever arm leaves the head at a different, but fixed, angle. The lever arm itself is described as an elastic rod. The chemical cycles of both heads are coordinated exclusively by the mechanical connection between the two lever arms. The model explains head coordination by showing that the lead head only binds to actin after the powerstroke in the trail head and that it only undergoes its powerstroke after the trail head unbinds from actin. Both models (four- and five-state) reproduce the observed hand-over-hand motion and fit the measured force-velocity relations. The main difference between the two models concerns the load dependence of the run length, which is much weaker in the five-state model. We show how systematic processivity measurement under varying conditions could be used to distinguish between both models and to determine the kinetic parameters.},

Furthermore, these motifs are found in hypervariable minisatellites and are clustered in the breakpoint regions of both disease-causing nonallelic homologous recombination hot spots and common mitochondrial deletion hot spots, implicating the motif as a driver of genome instability.},

abstract = {The detection of mutant spectra within a population of microorganisms is critical for the management of drug-resistant infections. We performed ultra-deep pyrosequencing to detect minor sequence variants in HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes from clinical plasma samples. We estimated empirical error rates from four HIV-1 plasmid clones and used them to develop a statistical approach to distinguish authentic minor variants from sequencing errors in eight clinical samples. Ultra-deep pyrosequencing detected an average of 58 variants per sample compared with an average of eight variants per sample detected by conventional direct-PCR dideoxynucleotide sequencing. In the clinical sample with the largest number of minor sequence variants, all 60 variants present in > or =3% of genomes and 20 of 35 variants present in <3% of genomes were confirmed by limiting dilution sequencing. With appropriate analysis, ultra-deep pyrosequencing is a promising method for characterizing genetic diversity and detecting minor yet clinically relevant variants in biological samples with complex genetic populations.},

title = {Evolutionary origin and maintenance of coexpressed gene clusters in mammals},
abstract = {Gene order is not random with regard to gene expression in mammals: coexpressed genes, and in particular housekeeping genes, are clustered along chromosomes more often than expected by chance. To understand the origin of these clusters and to quantify the impact of this phenomenon on genome organization, we analyzed clusters of coexpressed genes in the human and mouse genomes. We show that neighboring genes experience continuous concerted expression changes during evolution, which leads to the formation of coexpressed gene clusters. The pattern of expression within these clusters evolves more slowly than the genomic average. Moreover, by studying gene order evolution, we show that some clusters are maintained by natural selection and, therefore, have a functional significance. However, we also demonstrate that some coexpressed gene clusters are the result of neutral coevolution effects, as illustrated by the clustering of genes escaping inactivation on the X chromosome. Moreover, we show that, although statistically significant, constraints on gene orders have a limited impact on mammalian genome organization, affecting only 3-5% of the pool of human and murine genes. It had been hypothesized that coexpressed gene clusters might correspond to large chromatin domains. In contradiction, we find that most of these clusters contain only 2 genes whose coexpression may be due to transcriptional read-through or the activity of bidirectional promoters.},

title = {Rapid evolutionary escape by large populations from local fitness peaks is likely in nature},
abstract = {Fitness interactions between loci in the genome, or epistasis, can result in mutations that are individually deleterious but jointly beneficial. Such epistasis gives rise to multiple peaks on the genotypic fitness landscape. The problem of evolutionary escape from such local peaks has been a central problem of evolutionary genetics for at least 75 years. Much attention has focused on models of small populations, in which the sequential fixation of valley genotypes carrying individually deleterious mutations operates most quickly owing to genetic drift. However, valley genotypes can also be subject to mutation while transiently segregating, giving rise to copies of the high fitness escape genotype carrying the jointly beneficial mutations. In the absence of genetic recombination, these mutations may then fix simultaneously. The time for this process declines sharply with increasing population size, and it eventually comes to dominate evolutionary behavior. Here we develop an analytic expression for N(crit), the critical population size that defines the boundary between these regimes, which shows that both are likely to operate in nature. Frequent recombination may disrupt high-fitness escape genotypes produced in populations larger than N(crit) before they reach fixation, defining a third regime whose rate again slows with increasing population size. We develop a novel expression for this critical recombination rate, which shows that in large populations the simultaneous fixation of mutations that are beneficial only jointly is unlikely to be disrupted by genetic recombination if their map distance is on the order of the size of single genes. Thus, counterintuitively, mass selection alone offers a biologically realistic resolution to the problem of evolutionary escape from local fitness peaks in natural populations.},

title = {Single-crossover dynamics: Finite versus infinite populations},
abstract = {Populations evolving under the joint influence of recombination and resampling (traditionally known as genetic drift) are investigated. First, we summarize and adapt a deterministic approach, as valid for infinite populations, which assumes continuous time and single crossover events. The corresponding nonlinear system of differential equations permits a closed solution, both in terms of the type frequencies and via linkage disequilibria of all orders. To include stochastic effects, we then consider the corresponding finite-population model, the Moran model with single crossovers, and examine it both analytically and by means of simulations. Particular emphasis is on the connection with the deterministic solution. If there is only recombination and every pair of recombined offspring replaces their pair of parents (i.e., there is no resampling), then the expected type frequencies in the finite population, of arbitrary size, equal the type frequencies in the infinite population. If resampling is included, the stochastic process converges, in the infinite-population limit, to the deterministic dynamics, which turns out to be a good approximation already for populations of moderate size.},

title = {Sex and deleterious mutations},
abstract = {The evolutionary advantage of sexual reproduction has been considered as one of the most pressing questions in evolutionary biology. While a pluralistic view of the evolution of sex and recombination has been suggested by some, here we take a simpler view and try to quantify the conditions under which sex can evolve given a set of minimal assumptions. Since real populations are finite and also subject to recurrent deleterious mutations, this minimal model should apply generally to all populations. We show that the maximum advantage of recombination occurs for an intermediate value of the deleterious effect of mutations. Furthermore we show that the conditions under which the biggest advantage of sex is achieved are those that produce the fastest fitness decline in the corresponding asexual population and are therefore the conditions for which Muller's ratchet has the strongest effect. We also show that the selective advantage of a modifier of the recombination rate depends on its strength. The quantification of the range of selective effects that favors recombination then leads us to suggest that, if in stressful environments the effect of deleterious mutations is enhanced, a connection between sex and stress could be expected, as it is found in several species.},

The biological phenotype was determined on established cell lines (U937-2, CEM, and MT-2) and on the U87.CD4 coreceptor indicator cell lines and variable region 3 (V3) of the envelope was subjected to direct sequencing. All isolates obtained from lymph node subsets used CCR5 as coreceptor. Furthermore, these viruses were also sensitive to inhibition by beta-chemokines as analyzed for viruses of one patient. All 12 V3 regions showed a unique sequence indicating compartmentalization within each patient. The biological phenotype of CCR5-dependent (R5) HIV-1 isolates obtained from PBMC resembles the phenotype of viruses isolated from different lymph node cell subsets.},

Biological systems composed of tightly integrated parts seem to challenge this view, because it is not obvious how any element's function can be selected for unless the partners with which it interacts are already present. Here we demonstrate how an integrated molecular system-the specific functional interaction between the steroid hormone aldosterone and its partner the mineralocorticoid receptor-evolved by a stepwise Darwinian process. Using ancestral gene resurrection, we show that, long before the hormone evolved, the receptor's affinity for aldosterone was present as a structural by-product of its partnership with chemically similar, more ancient ligands. Introducing two amino acid changes into the ancestral sequence recapitulates the evolution of present-day receptor specificity. Our results indicate that tight interactions can evolve by molecular exploitation-recruitment of an older molecule, previously constrained for a different role, into a new functional complex.},

abstract = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between a donor (D) and an acceptor (A) at the single-molecule level currently provides qualitative information about distance, and quantitative information about kinetics of distance changes. Here, we used the sorting ability of confocal microscopy equipped with alternating-laser excitation (ALEX) to measure accurate FRET efficiencies and distances from single molecules, using corrections that account for cross-talk terms that contaminate the FRET-induced signal, and for differences in the detection efficiency and quantum yield of the probes. ALEX yields accurate FRET independent of instrumental factors, such as excitation intensity or detector alignment. Using DNA fragments, we showed that ALEX-based distances agree well with predictions from a cylindrical model of DNA; ALEX-based distances fit better to theory than distances obtained at the ensemble level. Distance measurements within transcription complexes agreed well with ensemble-FRET measurements, and with structural models based on ensemble-FRET and x-ray crystallography. ALEX can benefit structural analysis of biomolecules, especially when such molecules are inaccessible to conventional structural methods due to heterogeneity or transient nature.},

abstract = {Populations experiencing similar selection pressures can sometimes diverge in the genetic architectures underlying evolved complex traits. We used RNA virus populations of large size and high mutation rate to study the impact of historical environment on genome evolution, thus increasing our ability to detect repeatable patterns in the evolution of genetic architecture. Experimental vesicular stomatitis virus populations were evolved on HeLa cells, on MDCK cells, or on alternating hosts. Turner and Elena (2000. Cost of host radiation in an RNA virus. Genetics. 156:1465-1470.) previously showed that virus populations evolved in single-host environments achieved high fitness on their selected hosts but failed to increase in fitness relative to their ancestor on the unselected host and that alternating-host-evolved populations had high fitness on both hosts. Here we determined the complete consensus sequence for each evolved population after 95 generations to gauge whether the parallel phenotypic changes were associated with parallel genomic changes. We also analyzed the patterns of allele substitutions to discern whether differences in fitness across hosts arose through true pleiotropy or the presence of not only a mutation that is beneficial in both hosts but also 1 or more mutations at other loci that are costly in the unselected environment (mutation accumulation [MA]).

title = {Widespread genetic exchange among terrestrial bacteriophages},
abstract = {Bacteriophages are the most numerous entities in the biosphere. Despite this numerical dominance, the genetic structure of bacteriophage populations is poorly understood. Here, we present a biogeography study involving 25 previously undescribed bacteriophages from the Cystoviridae clade, a group characterized by a dsRNA genome divided into three segments. Previous laboratory manipulation has shown that, when multiple Cystoviruses infect a single host cell, they undergo (i) rare intrasegment recombination events and (ii) frequent genetic reassortment between segments. Analyzing linkage disequilibrium (LD) within segments, we find no significant evidence of intrasegment recombination in wild populations, consistent with (i). An extensive analysis of LD between segments supports frequent reassortment, on a time scale similar to the genomic mutation rate. The absence of LD within this group of phages is consistent with expectations for a completely sexual population, despite the fact that some segments have >50% nucleotide divergence at 4-fold degenerate sites. This extraordinary rate of genetic exchange between highly unrelated individuals is unprecedented in any taxa. We discuss our results in light of the biological species concept applied to viruses.},

It is particularly important in studies of lymphocyte homeostasis where its labelling of cells irrespective of their stage in the cell cycle makes it preferable to deuterated glucose and BrdU, which only label dividing cells and thus produce unrepresentative results. In the past, experiments have been limited by the need to obtain a clear separation of CFSE peaks forcing scientists to adopt a strategy of in vitro labelling of cells followed by their injection into the host. Here we develop a framework for analysis of in vivo CFSE labelling data. This enables us to estimate the rate of proliferation and death of lymphocytes in situ, and thus represents a considerable advance over current procedures. We illustrate this approach using in vivo CFSE labelling of B lymphocytes in sheep.},

abstract = {The composite-likelihood estimator (CLE) of the population recombination rate considers only sites with exactly two alleles under a finite-sites mutation model (McVean, G. A. T., P. Awadalla, and P. Fearnhead. 2002. A coalescent-based method for detecting and estimating recombination from gene sequences. Genetics 160:1231-1241). While in such a model the identity of alleles is not considered, the CLE has been shown to be robust to minor misspecification of the underlying mutational model. However, there are many situations where the putative mutation and demographic history can be quite complex. One good example is rapidly evolving pathogens, like HIV-1. First we evaluated the performance of the CLE and the likelihood permutation test (LPT) under more complex, realistic models, including a general time reversible (GTR) substitution model, rate heterogeneity among sites (Gamma), positive selection, population growth, population structure, and noncontemporaneous sampling. Second, we relaxed some of the assumptions of the CLE allowing for a four-allele, GTR + Gamma model in an attempt to use the data more efficiently. Through simulations and the analysis of real data, we concluded that the CLE is robust to severe misspecifications of the substitution model, but underestimates the recombination rate in the presence of exponential growth, population mixture, selection, or noncontemporaneous sampling. In such cases, the use of more complex models slightly increases performance in some occasions, especially in the case of the LPT. Thus, our results provide for a more robust application of the estimation of recombination rates.},

title = {Evolutionarily Stable Mutation Rate in a Periodically Changing Environment},
abstract = {Evolution of mutation rate controlled by a neutral modifier is studied for a locus with two alleles under temporally fluctuating selection pressure. A general formula is derived to calculate the evolutionarily stable mutation rate mu(ess) in an infinitely large haploid population, and following results are obtained. (I) For any fluctuation, periodic or random: (1) if the recombination rate r per generation between the modifier and the main locus is 0, mu(ess) is the same as the optimal mutation rate mu(op) which maximizes the long-term geometric average of population fitness; and (2) for any r, if the strength s of selection per generation is very large, mu(ess) is equal to the reciprocal of the average number T of generations (duration time) during which one allele is persistently favored than the other. (II) For a periodic fluctuation in the limit of small s and r, mu(ess)T is a function of sT and rT with properties: (1) for a given sT, mu(ess)T decreases with increasing rT; (2) for sT </= 1, mu(ess)T is almost independent of sT, and depends on rT as mu(ess)T {\&} 1.6 for rT << 1 and mu(ess)T {\&} 6/rT for rT >> 1; and (3) for sT >/= 1, and for a given rT, mu(ess)T decreases with increasing sT to a certain minimum less than 1, and then increases to 1 asymptotically in the limit of large sT. (III) For a fluctuation consisting of multiple Fourier components (i.e., sine wave components), the component with the longest period is the most effective in determining mu(ess) (low pass filter effect). (IV) When the cost c of preventing mutation is positive, the modifier is nonneutral, and mu(ess) becomes larger than in the case of neutral modifier under the same selection pressure acting at the main locus. The value of c which makes mu(ess) equal to mu(op) of the neutral modifier case is calculated. It is argued that this value gives a critical cost such that, so long as the actual cost exceeds this value, the evolution rate at the main locus must be smaller than its mutation rate mu(ess).},

abstract = {Evidence from inbred strains of mice indicates that a quarter or more of the mammalian genome consists of chromosome regions containing clusters of functionally related genes. The intense selection pressures during inbreeding favor the coinheritance of optimal sets of alleles among these genetically linked, functionally related genes, resulting in extensive domains of linkage disequilibrium (LD) among a set of 60 genetically diverse inbred strains. Recombination that disrupts the preferred combinations of alleles reduces the ability of offspring to survive further inbreeding. LD is also seen between markers on separate chromosomes, forming networks with scale-free architecture. Combining LD data with pathway and genome annotation databases, we have been able to identify the biological functions underlying several domains and networks. Given the strong conservation of gene order among mammals, the domains and networks we find in mice probably characterize all mammals, including humans.},

abstract = {We created Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) derived from a cross between ecotypes of Avena barbata associated with moist (mesic) and dry (xeric) habitats in California. Traits which were correlated with fitness across RILs mapped to the same Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) as fitness. However, different QTL affected fitness in different environments so that fitness was weakly correlated across environments. Recombination released considerable heritable variation both in fitness, and in ecologically relevant traits. Many traits showed transgressive segregation caused by recombination of QTL associated in repulsion phase in the parents. In addition, some traits were uncorrelated, allowing novel combinations of those traits to be created. Recombination also created heritable variation in reaction norms for at least one trait (root allocation). Altogether these results suggest that recombination can combine the most selectively advantageous genes and traits of the parents to produce broadly adapted genotypes that are capable of outperforming the parents. Indeed, two of the RILs showed higher fitness than the parental ecotypes across a range of environmental treatments in the greenhouse, but their superiority was less pronounced in the field. Although late-generation recombinants exhibited hybrid breakdown, being less fit, on average, than the mid-parent, early generation hybrids appear to exhibit hybrid vigour through the expression of dominance effects in the heterozyotes. This vigour may offset the effects of hybrid breakdown in the early generations following a cross, enhancing the opportunity for recombination to create broadly adapted genotypes. We discuss the implications of these findings to the evolution of colonizing species.},

title = {The effect of deleterious mutations on neutral molecular variation},
abstract = {Selection against deleterious alleles maintained by mutation may cause a reduction in the amount of genetic variability at linked neutral sites. This is because a new neutral variant can only remain in a large population for a long period of time if it is maintained in gametes that are free of deleterious alleles, and hence are not destined for rapid elimination from the population by selection. Approximate formulas are derived for the reduction below classical neutral values resulting from such background selection against deleterious mutations, for the mean times to fixation and loss of new mutations, nucleotide site diversity, and number of segregating sites. These formulas apply to random-mating populations with no genetic recombination, and to populations reproducing exclusively asexually or by self-fertilization. For a given selection regime and mating system, the reduction is an exponential function of the total mutation rate to deleterious mutations for the section of the genome involved. Simulations show that the effect decreases rapidly with increasing recombination frequency or rate of outcrossing. The mean time to loss of new neutral mutations and the total number of segregating neutral sites are less sensitive to background selection than the other statistics, unless the population size is of the order of a hundred thousand or more. The stationary distribution of allele frequencies at the neutral sites is correspondingly skewed in favor of rare alleles, compared with the classical neutral result. Observed reductions in molecular variation in low recombination genomic regions of sufficiently large size, for instance in the centromere-proximal regions of Drosophila autosomes or in highly selfing plant populations, may be partly due to background selection against deleterious mutations.},

title = {Adaptive evolution of non-coding DNA in Drosophila},
abstract = {A large fraction of eukaryotic genomes consists of DNA that is not translated into protein sequence, and little is known about its functional significance. Here I show that several classes of non-coding DNA in Drosophila are evolving considerably slower than synonymous sites, and yet show an excess of between-species divergence relative to polymorphism when compared with synonymous sites. The former is a hallmark of selective constraint, but the latter is a signature of adaptive evolution, resembling general patterns of protein evolution in Drosophila. I estimate that about 40-70% of nucleotides in intergenic regions, untranslated portions of mature mRNAs (UTRs) and most intronic DNA are evolutionarily constrained relative to synonymous sites. However, I also use an extension to the McDonald-Kreitman test to show that a substantial fraction of the nucleotide divergence in these regions was driven to fixation by positive selection (about 20% for most intronic and intergenic DNA, and 60% for UTRs). On the basis of these observations, I suggest that a large fraction of the non-translated genome is functionally important and subject to both purifying selection and adaptive evolution. These results imply that, although positive selection is clearly an important facet of protein evolution, adaptive changes to non-coding DNA might have been considerably more common in the evolution of D. melanogaster.},

Analysis of 96 additional patients with familial pancreatic cancer revealed three distinct protein-truncating mutations, thereby validating the role of PALB2 as a susceptibility gene for pancreatic cancer. PALB2 mutations have been previously reported in patients with familial breast cancer, and the PALB2 protein is a binding partner for BRCA2. These results illustrate that complete, unbiased sequencing of protein-coding genes can lead to the identification of a gene responsible for a hereditary disease.},

title = {Stepwise binding and bending of DNA by Escherichia coli integration host factor},
abstract = {Integration host factor (IHF) is a prokaryotic protein required for the integration of lambda phage DNA into its host genome. An x-ray crystal structure of the complex shows that IHF binds to the minor groove of DNA and bends the double helix by 160degrees [Rice PA, Yang S, Mizuuchi K, Nash HA (1996) Cell 87:1295-1306]. We sought to dissect the complex formation process into its component binding and bending reaction steps, using stopped-flow fluorimetry to observe changes in resonance energy transfer between DNA-bound dyes, which in turn reflect distance changes upon bending. Different DNA substrates that are likely to increase or decrease the DNA bending rate were studied, including one with a nick in a critical kink position, and a substrate with longer DNA ends to increase hydrodynamic friction during bending. Kinetic experiments were carried out under pseudofirst-order conditions, in which the protein concentration is in substantial excess over DNA. At lower concentrations, the reaction rate rises linearly with protein concentration, implying rate limitation by the bimolecular reaction step. At high concentrations the rate reaches a plateau value, which strongly depends on temperature and the nature of the DNA substrate. We ascribe this reaction limit to the DNA bending rate and propose that complex formation is sequential at high concentration: IHF binds rapidly to DNA, followed by slower DNA bending. Our observations on the bending step kinetics are in agreement with results using the temperature-jump kinetic method.},

title = {Deleterious mutations, apparent stabilizing selection and the maintenance of quantitative variation},
abstract = {Apparent stabilizing selection on a quantitative trait that is not causally connected to fitness can result from the pleiotropic effects of unconditionally deleterious mutations, because as N. Barton noted, "...individuals with extreme values of the trait will tend to carry more deleterious alleles...." We use a simple model to investigate the dependence of this apparent selection on the genomic deleterious mutation rate, U; the equilibrium distribution of K, the number of deleterious mutations per genome; and the parameters describing directional selection against deleterious mutations. Unlike previous analyses, we allow for epistatic selection against deleterious alleles. For various selection functions and realistic parameter values, the distribution of K, the distribution of breeding values for a pleiotropically affected trait, and the apparent stabilizing selection function are all nearly Gaussian. The additive genetic variance for the quantitative trait is kQa2, where k is the average number of deleterious mutations per genome, Q is the proportion of deleterious mutations that affect the trait, and a2 is the variance of pleiotropic effects for individual mutations that do affect the trait. In contrast, when the trait is measured in units of its additive standard deviation, the apparent fitness function is essentially independent of Q and a2; and beta, the intensity of selection, measured as the ratio of additive genetic variance to the "variance" of the fitness curve, is very close to s = U/k, the selection coefficient against individual deleterious mutations at equilibrium. Therefore, this model predicts appreciable apparent stabilizing selection if s exceeds about 0.03, which is consistent with various data. However, the model also predicts that beta must equal Vm/VG, the ratio of new additive variance for the trait introduced each generation by mutation to the standing additive variance. Most, although not all, estimates of this ratio imply apparent stabilizing selection weaker than generally observed. A qualitative argument suggests that even when direct selection is responsible for most of the selection observed on a character, it may be essentially irrelevant to the maintenance of variation for the character by mutation-selection balance. Simple experiments can indicate the fraction of observed stabilizing selection attributable to the pleiotropic effects of deleterious mutations.},

abstract = {Sequencing of multiple related species followed by comparative genomics analysis constitutes a powerful approach for the systematic understanding of any genome. Here, we use the genomes of 12 Drosophila species for the de novo discovery of functional elements in the fly. Each type of functional element shows characteristic patterns of change, or 'evolutionary signatures', dictated by its precise selective constraints. Such signatures enable recognition of new protein-coding genes and exons, spurious and incorrect gene annotations, and numerous unusual gene structures, including abundant stop-codon readthrough. Similarly, we predict non-protein-coding RNA genes and structures, and new microRNA (miRNA) genes. We provide evidence of miRNA processing and functionality from both hairpin arms and both DNA strands. We identify several classes of pre- and post-transcriptional regulatory motifs, and predict individual motif instances with high confidence. We also study how discovery power scales with the divergence and number of species compared, and we provide general guidelines for comparative studies.},

title = {THE EVOLUTION OF MULTILOCUS SYSTEMS UNDER WEAK SELECTION},
abstract = {The evolution of multilocus systems under weak selection is investigated. Generations are discrete and nonoverlapping; the monoecious population mates at random. The number of multiallelic loci, the linkage map, dominance, and epistasis are arbitrary. The genotypic fitnesses may depend on the gametic frequencies and time. The results hold for s much less than c(min), where s and c(min) denote the selection intensity and the smallest two-locus recombination frequency, respectively. After an evolutionarily short time of t1 approximately (ln s)/ln(l - c(min)) generations, all the multilocus linkage disequilibria are of the order of s [i.e., 0(s) as s --> 0], and then the population evolves approximately as if it were in linkage equilibrium, the error in the gametic frequencies being 0(s). Suppose the explicit time dependence (if any) of the genotypic fitnesses is O(s2). Then after a time t2 approximately 2t1, the linkage disequilibria are nearly constant, their rate of change being O(s2). Furthermore, with an error of O(s2), each linkage disequilibrium is proportional to the corresponding epistatic deviation for the interaction of additive effects on fitness. If the genotypic fitnesses change no faster than at the rate O(s3), then the single-generation change in the mean fitness is DELTAWBAR = WBAR-1V(g) + O(s3), where V(g) designates the genic (OT additive genetic) variance in fitness. The mean of a character with genotypic values whose single-generation change does not exceed 0(s2) evolves at the rate DELTAZBAR = WBAR-1C(g) + O(s2), where C(g) represents the genic covariance of the character and fitness (i.e., the covariance of the average effect on the character and the average excess for fitness of every allele that affects the character). Thus, after a short time t2, the absolute error in the fundamental and secondary theorems of natural selection is small, though the relative error may be large.},

abstract = {Fitch and Markowitz' theory of concomitantly variable codons (covarions) in evolution predicted the existence of functional correlation in amino acid residue mutations among present-day cytochromes c. Mutational analysis was carried out on yeast iso-2-cytochrome c, where hydrophobic core residues I20, M64, L85, and M98 and surface residue L9 were mutated, in selected combinations, to those found in mammalian and bird cytochromes c. The functionality assay is based upon the ability of yeast cells to grow in YPGE medium. Furthermore, experiments on the single M64L and M98L mutations as well as the double M64L/M98L mutation using NMR showed that the effects of these mutations are to perturb the structural integrity of the protein. We identified functional correlation in two cases of a pair of residue mutations, the I20-->V and M98-->L pair and the L9-->I and L85-->I pair. In both cases, only one of the two alternative, putative evolutionary pathways leads to a functional protein and the corresponding pairs of residue mutations are among those found in present-day cytochromes c. Since valine is predicted to be at position 20 in the ancestral form of cytochrome c, the present data provide an explanation for the ancient requirement of leucine rather than methionine in position 98. The present data provide further evidence for the role of those specific atom-atom interactions in directing a pathway in the evolutionary changes of the amino acid sequence that have taken place in cytochrome c, in accordance with Fitch and Markowitz.},

title = {Mutation patterns and structural correlates in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease following different protease inhibitor treatments},
abstract = {Although many human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected persons are treated with multiple protease inhibitors in combination or in succession, mutation patterns of protease isolates from these persons have not been characterized. We collected and analyzed 2,244 subtype B HIV-1 isolates from 1,919 persons with different protease inhibitor experiences: 1,004 isolates from untreated persons, 637 isolates from persons who received one protease inhibitor, and 603 isolates from persons receiving two or more protease inhibitors. The median number of protease mutations per isolate increased from 4 in untreated persons to 12 in persons who had received four or more protease inhibitors. Mutations at 45 of the 99 amino acid positions in the protease-including 22 not previously associated with drug resistance-were significantly associated with protease inhibitor treatment. Mutations at 17 of the remaining 99 positions were polymorphic but not associated with drug treatment. Pairs and clusters of correlated (covarying) mutations were significantly more likely to occur in treated than in untreated persons: 115 versus 23 pairs and 30 versus 2 clusters, respectively. Of the 115 statistically significant pairs of covarying residues in the treated isolates, 59 were within 8 A of each other-many more than would be expected by chance. In summary, nearly one-half of HIV-1 protease positions are under selective drug pressure, including many residues not previously associated with drug resistance. Structural factors appear to be responsible for the high frequency of covariation among many of the protease residues. The presence of mutational clusters provides insight into the complex mutational patterns required for HIV-1 protease inhibitor resistance.},

title = {The evolution of two-component systems in bacteria reveals different strategies for niche adaptation},
abstract = {Two-component systems including histidine protein kinases represent the primary signal transduction paradigm in prokaryotic organisms. To understand how these systems adapt to allow organisms to detect niche-specific signals, we analyzed the phylogenetic distribution of nearly 5,000 histidine protein kinases from 207 sequenced prokaryotic genomes. We found that many genomes carry a large repertoire of recently evolved signaling genes, which may reflect selective pressure to adapt to new environmental conditions. Both lineage-specific gene family expansion and horizontal gene transfer play major roles in the introduction of new histidine kinases into genomes; however, there are differences in how these two evolutionary forces act. Genes imported via horizontal transfer are more likely to retain their original functionality as inferred from a similar complement of signaling domains, while gene family expansion accompanied by domain shuffling appears to be a major source of novel genetic diversity. Family expansion is the dominant source of new histidine kinase genes in the genomes most enriched in signaling proteins, and detailed analysis reveals that divergence in domain structure and changes in expression patterns are hallmarks of recent expansions. Finally, while these two modes of gene acquisition are widespread across bacterial taxa, there are clear species-specific preferences for which mode is used.},

title = {Ezrin is a target for oncogenic Kit mutants in murine erythroleukemia},
abstract = {The model of erythroleukemia caused by Spi-1/PU.1 transgenesis in mice is a multi-stage disease. A preleukemic step is characterized by an acute proliferation of proerythroblasts due to the arrest of differentiation provoked by Spi-1/PU.1. Later on, a blastic crisis occurs associated to somatic oncogenic mutations in the SCF receptor Kit. To gain insights into the mechanisms of the leukemic progression, we performed proteomic profiling analyses of proerythroblasts isolated at the two stages of the disease. Our results indicate that the level of ezrin, a membrane cytoskeletal crosslinker, is increased in the leukemic cells. We showed that Kit oncogenic forms are responsible for ezrin phosphorylation and that phosphorylation rather than overexpression is essential in the leukemic proerythroblasts. Using expression of dominant-negative forms of ezrin, we showed that phosphorylation of ezrin on residue Y353 participates in apoptosis resistance whereas phosphorylation on residue Y145 promotes proliferation of the leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo. Another recurrent oncogenic form of tyrosine kinases (Flt3) most frequently involved in human myeloid leukemia was also able to phosphorylate ezrin. These findings point to a new role for ezrin as signaling player in the development of leukemia, being a downstream effector of oncogenic tyrosine kinases in leukemic blasts.},

title = {Life at the front of an expanding population},
abstract = { Recent microbial experiments suggest that enhanced genetic drift at the frontier of a two-dimensional range expansion can cause genetic sectoring patterns with fractal domain boundaries. Here, we propose and analyze a simple model of asexual biological evolution at expanding frontiers to explain these neutral patterns and predict the effect of natural selection. Our model attributes the observed gradual decrease in the number of sectors at the leading edge to an unbiased random walk of sector boundaries. Natural selection introduces a deterministic bias in the wandering of domain boundaries that renders beneficial mutations more likely to escape genetic drift and become established in a sector. We find that the opening angle of those sectors and the rate at which they become established depend sensitively on the selective advantage of the mutants. Deleterious mutations, on the other hand, are not able to establish a sector permanently. They can, however, temporarily "surf" on the population front, and thereby reach unusual high frequencies. As a consequence, expanding frontiers are susceptible to deleterious mutations as revealed by the high fraction of mutants at mutation-selection balance. Numerically, we also determine the condition at which the wild type is lost in favor of deleterious mutants (genetic meltdown) at a growing front. Our prediction for this error threshold differs qualitatively from existing well-mixed theories, and sets tight constraints on sustainable mutation rates for populations that undergo frequent range expansions. },

title = {The role of epistasis in the manifestation of heterosis: a systems-oriented approach},
abstract = {Heterosis is widely used in breeding, but the genetic basis of this biological phenomenon has not been elucidated. We postulate that additive and dominance genetic effects as well as two-locus interactions estimated in classical QTL analyses are not sufficient for quantifying the contributions of QTL to heterosis. A general theoretical framework for determining the contributions of different types of genetic effects to heterosis was developed. Additive x additive epistatic interactions of individual loci with the entire genetic background were identified as a major component of midparent heterosis. On the basis of these findings we defined a new type of heterotic effect denoted as augmented dominance effect di* that comprises the dominance effect at each QTL minus half the sum of additive x additive interactions with all other QTL. We demonstrate that genotypic expectations of QTL effects obtained from analyses with the design III using testcrosses of recombinant inbred lines and composite-interval mapping precisely equal genotypic expectations of midparent heterosis, thus identifying genomic regions relevant for expression of heterosis. The theory for QTL mapping of multiple traits is extended to the simultaneous mapping of newly defined genetic effects to improve the power of QTL detection and distinguish between dominance and overdominance.},

title = {Viral dynamics in vivo: limitations on estimates of intracellular delay and virus decay},
abstract = {Anti-viral drug treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections causes rapid reduction in plasma virus load. Viral decline occurs in several phases and provides information on important kinetic constants of virus replication in vivo and pharmacodynamical properties. We develop a mathematical model that takes into account the intracellular phase of the viral life-cycle, defined as the time between infection of a cell and production of new virus particles. We derive analytic solutions for the dynamics following treatment with reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, or a combination of both. For HIV-1, our results show that the phase of rapid decay in plasma virus (days 2-7) allows precise estimates for the turnover rate of productively infected cells. The initial quasi-stationary phase (days 0-1) and the transition phase (days 1-2) are explained by the combined effects of pharmacological and intracellular delays, the clearance of free virus particles, and the decay of infected cells. Reliable estimates of the first three quantities are not possible from data on virus load only; such estimates require additional measurements. In contrast with HIV-1, for HBV our model predicts that frequent early sampling of plasma virus will lead to reliable estimates of the free virus half-life and the pharmacological properties of the administered drug. On the other hand, for HBV the half-life of infected cells cannot be estimated from plasma virus decay.},

A highly conserved pathway of miRNA biogenesis is closely linked to the transport and translatability of mRNAs in neurons. Although there are nearly 500 known human miRNA sequences, each of only approximately 21 nucleotides, which bind to multiple mRNA targets, the accurate prediction of miRNA targets seems to lie just beyond our grasp.

We carried out association analysis with these SNPs to identify genetic variants that predispose to T2D, compared our T2D association results with the results of two similar studies, and genotyped 80 SNPs in an additional 1215 Finnish T2D cases and 1258 Finnish NGT controls. We identify T2D-associated variants in an intergenic region of chromosome 11p12, contribute to the identification of T2D-associated variants near the genes IGF2BP2 and CDKAL1 and the region of CDKN2A and CDKN2B, and confirm that variants near TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, FTO, PPARG, and KCNJ11 are associated with T2D risk.

abstract = {Clinical evidence suggests that cellular immunity is involved in controlling human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) replication. An animal model of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected rhesus monkey, was used to show that virus replication is not controlled in monkeys depleted of CD8+ lymphocytes during primary SIV infection. Eliminating CD8+ lymphocytes from monkeys during chronic SIV infection resulted in a rapid and marked increase in viremia that was again suppressed coincident with the reappearance of SIV-specific CD8+ T cells. These results confirm the importance of cell-mediated immunity in controlling HIV-1 infection and support the exploration of vaccination approaches for preventing infection that will elicit these immune responses.},

In asexual populations, however, clones that carry such alternative beneficial mutations compete with one another and, thereby, interfere with the expected progression of a given mutation to fixation. From theoretical exploration of such 'clonal interference', we have derived (1) a fixation probability for beneficial mutations, (2) an expected substitution rate, (3) an expected coefficient of selection for realized substitutions, (4) an expected rate of fitness increase, (5) the probability that a beneficial mutation transiently achieves polymorphic frequency (> or = 1%), and (6) the probability that a beneficial mutation transiently achieves majority status. Based on (2) and (3), we were able to estimate the beneficial mutation rate and the distribution of mutational effects from changes in mean fitness in an evolving E. coli population.},

title = {Compound tests for the detection of hitchhiking under positive selection},
abstract = {Many statistical tests have been developed for detecting positive selection. Most of these tests draw conclusions based on significant deviations from the patterns of polymorphism predicted by the neutral model. However, many non-equilibrium forces may cause similar deviations, and thus the tests usually have low statistical specificity to positive selection. The main challenge is hence to construct test statistics that are reasonably powerful in detecting positive selection, but are relatively insensitive to other forces. Recently, Zeng et al. (2006) proposed a new test, DH, which is a compound of Tajima's D and Fay and Wu's H, and showed that DH has reasonably high statistical specificity to positive selection. In this report, we expand the idea of a compound test by combining Fay and Wu's H or DH with the Ewens-Watterson (EW) test. We refer to these 2 new tests as HEW and DHEW, respectively. Compared to the DH test, HEW and DHEW are more robust against the presence of recombination, and are also more powerful in detecting positive selection. Furthermore, the DHEW test, similar to DH, is also relatively insensitive to background selection and demography. The HEW test, on the other hand, tends to be somewhat less conservative than DH and DHEW in some cases.},

abstract = {We explored genomic expression patterns in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae responding to diverse environmental transitions. DNA microarrays were used to measure changes in transcript levels over time for almost every yeast gene, as cells responded to temperature shocks, hydrogen peroxide, the superoxide-generating drug menadione, the sulfhydryl-oxidizing agent diamide, the disulfide-reducing agent dithiothreitol, hyper- and hypo-osmotic shock, amino acid starvation, nitrogen source depletion, and progression into stationary phase. A large set of genes (approximately 900) showed a similar drastic response to almost all of these environmental changes. Additional features of the genomic responses were specialized for specific conditions. Promoter analysis and subsequent characterization of the responses of mutant strains implicated the transcription factors Yap1p, as well as Msn2p and Msn4p, in mediating specific features of the transcriptional response, while the identification of novel sequence elements provided clues to novel regulators. Physiological themes in the genomic responses to specific environmental stresses provided insights into the effects of those stresses on the cell.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, many studies documented high genetic divergence between closely related species in genomic regions experiencing restricted recombination in hybrids, such as within chromosomal rearrangements or areas adjacent to centromeres. Such regions have been called 'islands of speciation' because of their presumed role in maintaining the integrity of species despite gene flow elsewhere in the genome. Here, we review alternative explanations for such patterns. Segregation of ancestral variation or artifacts of nucleotide diversity within species can readily lead to higher F(ST) in regions of restricted recombination than other parts of the genome, even in the complete absence of interspecies gene flow, and thereby cause investigators to erroneously conclude that islands of speciation exist. We conclude by discussing strengths and weaknesses of various means for testing the role of restricted recombination in maintaining species.},

title = {Consistent viral evolutionary changes associated with the progression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection},
abstract = {To understand the high variability of the asymptomatic interval between primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and the development of AIDS, we studied the evolution of the C2-V5 region of the HIV-1 env gene and of T-cell subsets in nine men with a moderate or slow rate of disease progression. They were monitored from the time of seroconversion for a period of 6 to 12 years until the development of advanced disease in seven men. Based on the analysis of viral divergence from the founder strain, viral population diversity within sequential time points, and the outgrowth of viruses capable of utilizing the CXCR4 receptor (X4 viruses), the existence of three distinct phases within the asymptomatic interval is suggested: an early phase of variable duration during which linear increases ( approximately 1% per year) in both divergence and diversity were observed; an intermediate phase lasting an average of 1.8 years, characterized by a continued increase in divergence but with stabilization or decline in diversity; and a late phase characterized by a slowdown or stabilization of divergence and continued stability or decline in diversity. X4 variants emerged around the time of the early- to intermediate-phase transition and then achieved peak representation and began a decline around the transition between the intermediate and late phases. The late-phase transition was also associated with failure of T-cell homeostasis (defined by a downward inflection in CD3(+) T cells) and decline of CD4(+) T cells to </=200 cells/microliter. The strength of these temporal associations between viral divergence and diversity, viral coreceptor specificity, and T-cell homeostasis and subset composition supports the concept that the phases described represent a consistent pattern of viral evolution during the course of HIV-1 infection in moderate progressors. Recognition of this pattern may help explain previous conflicting data on the relationship between viral evolution and disease progression and may provide a useful framework for evaluating immune damage and recovery in untreated and treated HIV-1 infections.},

title = {Tempo and mode of nucleotide substitutions in gag and env gene fragments in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 populations with a known transmission history},
abstract = {The complex evolutionary process of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is marked by a high level of genetic variation. It has been shown that the HIV-1 genome is characterized by variable and more constant regions, unequal nucleotide frequencies, and preference for G-to-A substitutions. However, this knowledge has largely been neglected in phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 nucleotide sequences, even though these analyses are applied to a number of important biological questions. The purpose of this study was to identify a realistic model of HIV-1 evolution and to statistically test if the application of such a model significantly improves the accuracy of phylogenetic analyses. A unique and recently reported HIV-1 transmission cluster consisting of nine infected individuals, for whom the direction and time for each transmission were exactly known, formed the basis for the analyses which were performed under a general model of nucleotide substitution using population sequences from the env V3 and p17gag regions of the HIV-1 genome. Examination of seven different substitution models by maximum-likelihood methods revealed that the fit of the general reversible (REV) model was significantly better than that of simpler models, indicating that it is important to account for the asymmetric substitution pattern of HIV-1 and that the nucleotide substitution rate varied significantly across sites. The shape parameter alpha, which describes the variation across sites by a gamma distribution, was estimated to be 0.38 and 0.25 for env V3 and p17gag, respectively. In env V3, the estimated average transition/transversion rate ratio was 1.42. Thus, the REV model with variable rates across sites (described by a gamma distribution) provides the best description of HIV-1 evolution, whereas simple models are unrealistic and inaccurate. It is likely that the accuracy of phylogenetic studies of HIV-1 and many other viruses would improve substantially by the use of more realistic nucleotide substitution models. This is especially true when attempts are made to estimate the age of distant viral ancestors from contemporary viral sequences.},

abstract = {We consider a family of models describing the evolution under selection of a population whose dynamics can be related to the propagation of noisy traveling waves. For one particular model that we shall call the exponential model, the properties of the traveling wave front can be calculated exactly, as well as the statistics of the genealogy of the population. One striking result is that, for this particular model, the genealogical trees have the same statistics as the trees of replicas in the Parisi mean-field theory of spin glasses. We also find that in the exponential model, the coalescence times along these trees grow like the logarithm of the population size. A phenomenological picture of the propagation of wave fronts that we introduced in a previous work, as well as our numerical data, suggest that these statistics remain valid for a larger class of models, while the coalescence times grow like the cube of the logarithm of the population size.},

Of particular interest is the role of population size on genetic draft. Remarkably, the rate of substitution of weakly selected advantageous mutations decreases with increasing population size, whereas that for deleterious mutations increases with population size. This dependency on population size is the opposite of that for genetic drift. Moreover, these rates are only weakly dependent on population size, again contrary to the strong dependency of drift-based dynamics. Four models of the strongly selected loci responsible for genetic draft are examined. Three of these exhibit a very weak dependency on population size, which implies that their induced effects will also be weakly dependent on population size. Together, these results suggest that population size and binomial sampling may not be relevant to a species' evolution. If this is the case, then a number of evolutionary conundrums are resolved.},

abstract = {Polymorphism data can be used to identify loci at which a beneficial allele has recently gone to fixation, given that an accurate description of the signature of selection is available. In the classical model that is used, a favored allele derives from a single mutational origin. This ignores the fact that beneficial alleles can enter a population recurrently by mutation during the selective phase. In this study, we present a combination of analytical and simulation results to demonstrate the effect of adaptation from recurrent mutation on summary statistics for polymorphism data from a linked neutral locus. We also analyze the power of standard neutrality tests based on the frequency spectrum or on linkage disequilibrium (LD) under this scenario. For recurrent beneficial mutation at biologically realistic rates, we find substantial deviations from the classical pattern of a selective sweep from a single new mutation. Deviations from neutrality in the level of polymorphism and in the frequency spectrum are much less pronounced than in the classical sweep pattern. In contrast, for levels of LD, the signature is even stronger if recurrent beneficial mutation plays a role. We suggest a variant of existing LD tests that increases their power to detect this signature.},

title = {Epistasis and the selective advantage of sex and recombination},
abstract = {The understanding of the central mechanisms favoring sex and recombination in real populations is one of the fundamental issues in evolutionary biology. Based on a previous stochastic formulation for the study of sex, here we aim to investigate the conditions under which epistasis favors the fixation of the sexual mode of reproduction in a given population. In addition, we try to identify the evolutionary forces which contribute to this process. One considers a finite population model which assumes the existence of a recombination modifier allele that can activate the recombination mechanism. We have found that sex is very little favored in a scenario of antagonistic epistasis, and this advantage only occurs in a narrow range of values of the selection coefficient s_{d} . On the other hand, synergistic epistasis favors recombination in a very broad domain. However, the major mechanism contributing to the spreading of the modifier allele depends on the range of values of s_{d} . At large s_{d} , background selection favors recombination since it increases the efficacy of selection, while at low s_{d} Muller's ratchet is the leading mechanism.},

abstract = {Geographically structured genetic variants provide an effective means to assess sources of natural selection and mechanisms of adaptation to local environments. Correlated selection pressures along environmental gradients favor subdivision of genomes through chromosomal rearrangement. This study examines populations of Drosophila americana to evaluate selection pressures affecting chromosomal forms distinguished by a centromeric fusion. Analyses of chromosomal polymorphism throughout the Mississippi River Valley in the central United States reveal the presence of a distinct latitudinal cline for the chromosomal rearrangement. The cline has a width of 623 km centered at 35.97 degrees N and displays a characteristic sigmoid shape consistent with a balance between selection and dispersal. Extreme low temperature during January, an indicator of winter severity, was identified as the environmental variable that most accurately predicts arrangement frequency. An intriguing relationship identified between the chromosomal cline and operational sex ratio indicates that these alternative arrangements of the X chromosome may influence sex-specific survival. A hypothesis for the cline is presented wherein variation associated with the alternative chromosome forms influence distinct overwintering strategies. The resulting subdivision within the genome embodies a transitory stage of a speciation process where locally adapted gene complexes provide a foundation for species formation.},

title = {HIV-1 subtype B protease and reverse transcriptase amino acid covariation},
abstract = {Despite the high degree of HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) mutation in the setting of antiretroviral therapy, the spectrum of possible virus variants appears to be limited by patterns of amino acid covariation. We analyzed patterns of amino acid covariation in protease and RT sequences from more than 7,000 persons infected with HIV-1 subtype B viruses obtained from the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database (http://hivdb.stanford.edu). In addition, we examined the relationship between conditional probabilities associated with a pair of mutations and the order in which those mutations developed in viruses for which longitudinal sequence data were available. Patterns of RT covariation were dominated by the distinct clustering of Type I and Type II thymidine analog mutations and the Q151M-associated mutations. Patterns of protease covariation were dominated by the clustering of nelfinavir-associated mutations (D30N and N88D), two main groups of protease inhibitor (PI)-resistance mutations associated either with V82A or L90M, and a tight cluster of mutations associated with decreased susceptibility to amprenavir and the most recently approved PI darunavir. Different patterns of covariation were frequently observed for different mutations at the same position including the RT mutations T69D versus T69N, L74V versus L74I, V75I versus V75M, T215F versus T215Y, and K219Q/E versus K219N/R, and the protease mutations M46I versus M46L, I54V versus I54M/L, and N88D versus N88S. Sequence data from persons with correlated mutations in whom earlier sequences were available confirmed that the conditional probabilities associated with correlated mutation pairs could be used to predict the order in which the mutations were likely to have developed. Whereas accessory nucleoside RT inhibitor-resistance mutations nearly always follow primary nucleoside RT inhibitor-resistance mutations, accessory PI-resistance mutations often preceded primary PI-resistance mutations.},

title = {Genome complexity, robustness and genetic interactions in digital organisms},
abstract = {Digital organisms are computer programs that self-replicate, mutate and adapt by natural selection. They offer an opportunity to test generalizations about living systems that may extend beyond the organic life that biologists usually study. Here we have generated two classes of digital organism: simple programs selected solely for rapid replication, and complex programs selected to perform mathematical operations that accelerate replication through a set of defined 'metabolic' rewards. To examine the differences in their genetic architecture, we introduced millions of single and multiple mutations into each organism and measured the effects on the organism's fitness. The complex organisms are more robust than the simple ones with respect to the average effects of single mutations. Interactions among mutations are common and usually yield higher fitness than predicted from the component mutations assuming multiplicative effects; such interactions are especially important in the complex organisms. Frequent interactions among mutations have also been seen in bacteria, fungi and fruitflies. Our findings support the view that interactions are a general feature of genetic systems.},

abstract = {The accurate identification of HIV-specific T cell responses is important for determining the relationship between immune response, viral control, and disease progression. HIV-specific immune responses are usually measured using peptide sets based on consensus sequences, which frequently miss responses to regions where test set and infecting virus differ. In this study, we report the design of a peptide test set with significantly increased coverage of HIV sequence diversity by including alternative amino acids at variable positions during the peptide synthesis step. In an IFN-gamma ELISpot assay, these "toggled" peptides detected HIV-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses of significantly higher breadth and magnitude than matched consensus peptides. The observed increases were explained by a closer match of the toggled peptides to the autologous viral sequence. Toggled peptides therefore afford a cost-effective and significantly more complete view of the host immune response to HIV and are directly applicable to other variable pathogens.},

abstract = {An open question in animal evolution is why the phylum- and superphylum-level body plans have changed so little, while the class- and family-level body plans have changed so greatly since the early Cambrian. Davidson and Erwin (Davidson and Erwin, 2006; Erwin and Davidson, 2009) proposed that the hierarchical structure of gene regulatory networks leads to different observed evolutionary rates for terminal properties of the body plan versus major aspects of body plan morphology. Here, we calculated the speed of evolution of genes in these gene regulatory networks. We found that the genes which determine the phylum and superphylum characters evolve slowly, while those genes which determine the classes, families, and speciation evolve more rapidly. This result furnishes genetic support to the hypothesis that the hierarchical structure of developmental regulatory networks provides an organizing structure which guides the evolution of aspects of the body plan.},

abstract = {Identification of full-length transmitted HIV-1 genomes could be instrumental in HIV-1 pathogenesis, microbicide, and vaccine research by enabling the direct analysis of those viruses actually responsible for productive clinical infection. We show in 12 acutely infected subjects (9 clade B and 3 clade C) that complete HIV-1 genomes of transmitted/founder viruses can be inferred by single genome amplification and sequencing of plasma virion RNA. This allowed for the molecular cloning and biological analysis of transmitted/founder viruses and a comprehensive genome-wide assessment of the genetic imprint left on the evolving virus quasispecies by a composite of host selection pressures. Transmitted viruses encoded intact canonical genes (gag-pol-vif-vpr-tat-rev-vpu-env-nef) and replicated efficiently in primary human CD4(+) T lymphocytes but much less so in monocyte-derived macrophages. Transmitted viruses were CD4 and CCR5 tropic and demonstrated concealment of coreceptor binding surfaces of the envelope bridging sheet and variable loop 3. 2 mo after infection, transmitted/founder viruses in three subjects were nearly completely replaced by viruses differing at two to five highly selected genomic loci; by 12-20 mo, viruses exhibited concentrated mutations at 17-34 discrete locations. These findings reveal viral properties associated with mucosal HIV-1 transmission and a limited set of rapidly evolving adaptive mutations driven primarily, but not exclusively, by early cytotoxic T cell responses.},

title = {Evolution in random fitness landscapes: the infinite sites model},
abstract = {We consider the evolution of an asexually reproducing population in an uncorrelated random fitness landscape in the limit of infinite genome size, which implies that each mutation generates a new fitness value drawn from a probability distribution g(w). This is the finite population version of Kingman's house of cards model (Kingman 1978 J. Appl. Probab. 15 1). In contrast to Kingman's work, the focus here is on unbounded distributions g( w) which lead to an indefinite growth of the population fitness. The model is solved analytically in the limit of infinite population size N -> infinity and simulated numerically for infinite N. When the genome-wide mutation probability U is small, the long-time behavior of the model reduces to a point process of fixation events, which is referred to as a diluted record process (DRP). The DRP is similar to the standard record process except that a new record candidate (a number that exceeds all previous entries in the sequence) is accepted only with a certain probability that depends on the values of the current record and the candidate. We develop a systematic analytic approximation scheme for the DRP. At finite U the fitness frequency distribution of the population decomposes into a stationary part due to mutations and a traveling wave component due to selection, which is shown to imply a reduction of the mean fitness by a factor of 1 - U compared to the U -> 0 limit.},

abstract = {Genetic theories of adaptation generally overlook the genes in which beneficial substitutions occur, and the likely variation in their mutational effects. We investigate the consequences of heterogeneous mutational effects among loci on the genetics of adaptation. We use a generalization of Fisher's geometrical model, which assumes multivariate Gaussian stabilizing selection on multiple characters. In our model, mutation has a distinct variance-covariance matrix of phenotypic effects for each locus. Consequently, the distribution of selection coefficients s varies across loci. We assume each locus can only affect a limited number of independent linear combinations of phenotypic traits (restricted pleiotropy), which differ among loci, an effect we term "orientation heterogeneity." Restricted pleiotropy can sharply reduce the overall proportion of beneficial mutations. Orientation heterogeneity has little impact on the shape of the genomic distribution, but can substantially increase the probability of parallel evolution (the repeated fixation of beneficial mutations at the same gene in independent populations), which is highest with low pleiotropy. We also consider variation in the degree of pleiotropy and in the mean s across loci. The latter impacts the genomic distribution of s, but has a much milder effect on parallel evolution. We discuss these results in the light of evolution experiments.},

abstract = {Many studies have identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that contribute to continuous variation in heritable traits of interest. However, general principles regarding the distribution of QTL numbers, effect sizes, and combined effects of multiple QTLs remain to be elucidated. Here, we characterize complex genetics underlying inheritance of thousands of transcript levels in a cross between two strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Most detected QTLs have weak effects, with a median variance explained of 27% for highly heritable transcripts. Despite the high statistical power of the study, no QTLs were detected for 40% of highly heritable transcripts, indicating extensive genetic complexity. Modeling of QTL detection showed that only 3% of highly heritable transcripts are consistent with single-locus inheritance, 17-18% are consistent with control by one or two loci, and half require more than five loci under additive models. Strikingly, analysis of parent and progeny trait distributions showed that a majority of transcripts exhibit transgressive segregation. Sixteen percent of highly heritable transcripts exhibit evidence of interacting loci. Our results will aid design of future QTL mapping studies and may shed light on the evolution of quantitative traits.},

title = {EXTINCTIONS IN HETEROGENEOUS ENVIRONMENTS AND THE EVOLUTION OF MODULARITY},
abstract = {Extinctions of local subpopulations are common events in nature. Here, we ask whether such extinctions can affect the design of biological networks within organisms over evolutionary timescales. We study the impact of extinction events on modularity of biological systems, a common architectural principle found on multiple scales in biology. As a model system, we use networks that evolve toward goals specified as desired input-output relationships. We use an extinction-recolonization model, in which metapopulations occupy and migrate between different localities. Each locality displays a different environmental condition (goal), but shares the same set of subgoals with other localities. We find that in the absence of extinction events, the evolved computational networks are typically highly optimal for their localities with a nonmodular structure. In contrast, when local populations go extinct from time to time, we find that the evolved networks are modular in structure. Modular circuitry is selected because of its ability to adapt rapidly to the conditions of the free niche following an extinction event. This rapid adaptation is mainly achieved through genetic recombination of modules between immigrants from neighboring local populations. This study suggests, therefore, that extinctions in heterogeneous environments promote the evolution of modular biological network structure, allowing local populations to effectively recombine their modules to recolonize niches.},

abstract = {The exact mechanisms by which HIV overwhelms the immune system remain poorly understood. Among the several explanations of HIV disease progression, most include adaptation of the viral genome to the host environment as a causal factor. Therefore, quantifying the rate and pattern of adaptive evolution within infected patients is critical to understanding the development of AIDS. Using sequence data from infected individuals sampled at multiple time points, I estimate the within-host adaptation rate of the HIV-1 env gene for viral populations from 50 different patients. I find that, averaging across patients, one adaptive substitution occurs every 3.3 months. Also, one adaptive mutation is driven to a high frequency (>50% but <100%) every 2.5 months. Taken together, such adaptive events occur once every 25 viral generations, which is the fastest adaptation rate ever recorded for a single protein-coding gene. Within the entire env gene, I estimate that a majority ( approximately 55%) of both nonsynonymous substitutions and high-frequency polymorphisms are adaptive. Further, in the C2-V5 region of env, I find that patients with longer asymptomatic periods have virus populations with higher adaptation rates, corroborating the notion that a broad, strong immune response against epitopes in the env gene product leads to longer asymptomatic periods. I conclude by discussing the distribution of nonsynonymous changes over the env gene.},

title = {Population genetics of tumor suppressor genes},
abstract = {Cancer emerges when a single cell receives multiple mutations. For example, the inactivation of both alleles of a tumor suppressor gene (TSG) can imply a net reproductive advantage of the cell and might lead to clonal expansion. In this paper, we calculate the probability as a function of time that a population of cells has generated at least one cell with two inactivated alleles of a TSG. Different kinetic laws hold for small and large populations. The inactivation of the first allele can either be neutral or lead to a selective advantage or disadvantage. The inactivation of the first and of the second allele can occur at equal or different rates. Our calculations provide insights into basic aspects of population genetics determining cancer initiation and progression.},

title = {Ancient and recent positive selection transformed opioid cis-regulation in humans},
abstract = {Changes in the cis-regulation of neural genes likely contributed to the evolution of our species' unique attributes, but evidence of a role for natural selection has been lacking. We found that positive natural selection altered the cis-regulation of human prodynorphin, the precursor molecule for a suite of endogenous opioids and neuropeptides with critical roles in regulating perception, behavior, and memory. Independent lines of phylogenetic and population genetic evidence support a history of selective sweeps driving the evolution of the human prodynorphin promoter. In experimental assays of chimpanzee-human hybrid promoters, the selected sequence increases transcriptional inducibility. The evidence for a change in the response of the brain's natural opioids to inductive stimuli points to potential human-specific characteristics favored during evolution. In addition, the pattern of linked nucleotide and microsatellite variation among and within modern human populations suggests that recent selection, subsequent to the fixation of the human-specific mutations and the peopling of the globe, has favored different prodynorphin cis-regulatory alleles in different parts of the world.},

title = {Signal transduction networks: topology, response and biochemical processes},
abstract = {Conventionally, biological signal transduction networks are analysed using experimental and theoretical methods to describe specific protein components, interactions, and biochemical processes and to model network behavior under various conditions. While these studies provide crucial information on specific networks, this information is not easily converted to a broader understanding of signal transduction systems. Here, using a specific model of protein interaction we analyse small network topologies to understand their response and general properties. In particular, we catalogue the response for all possible topologies of a given network size to generate a response distribution, analyse the effects of specific biochemical processes on this distribution, and analyse the robustness and diversity of responses with respect to internal fluctuations or mutations in the network. The results show that even three- and four-protein networks are capable of creating diverse and biologically relevant responses, that the distribution of response types changes drastically as a function of biochemical processes at protein level, and that certain topologies strongly pre-dispose a specific response type while others allow for diverse types of responses. This study sheds light on the response types and properties that could be expected from signal transduction networks, provides possible explanations for the role of certain biochemical processes in signal transduction and suggests novel approaches to interfere with signaling pathways at the molecular level. Furthermore it shows that network topology plays a key role on determining response type and properties and that proper representation of network topology is crucial to discover and understand so-called building blocks of large networks.},

abstract = { Existing theoretical models of evolution focus on the relative fitness advantages of different mutants in a population while the dynamic behavior of the population size is mostly left unconsidered. We here present a generic stochastic model which combines the growth dynamics of the population and its internal evolution. Our model thereby accounts for the fact that both evolutionary and growth dynamics are based on individual reproduction events and hence are highly coupled and stochastic in nature. We exemplify our approach by studying the dilemma of cooperation in growing populations and show that genuinely stochastic events can ease the dilemma by leading to a transient but robust increase in cooperation },

title = {The effects of Hill-Robertson interference between weakly selected mutations on patterns of molecular evolution and variation},
abstract = {Associations between selected alleles and the genetic backgrounds on which they are found can reduce the efficacy of selection. We consider the extent to which such interference, known as the Hill-Robertson effect, acting between weakly selected alleles, can restrict molecular adaptation and affect patterns of polymorphism and divergence. In particular, we focus on synonymous-site mutations, considering the fate of novel variants in a two-locus model and the equilibrium effects of interference with multiple loci and reversible mutation. We find that weak selection Hill-Robertson (wsHR) interference can considerably reduce adaptation, e.g., codon bias, and, to a lesser extent, levels of polymorphism, particularly in regions of low recombination. Interference causes the frequency distribution of segregating sites to resemble that expected from more weakly selected mutations and also generates specific patterns of linkage disequilibrium. While the selection coefficients involved are small, the fitness consequences of wsHR interference across the genome can be considerable. We suggest that wsHR interference is an important force in the evolution of nonrecombining genomes and may explain the unexpected constancy of codon bias across species of very different census population sizes, as well as several unusual features of codon usage in Drosophila.},

abstract = {Identification of the selective forces contributing to the origin and maintenance of sex is a fundamental problem in biology. The Fisher-Muller model proposes that sex is advantageous because it allows beneficial mutations that arise in different lineages to recombine, thereby reducing clonal interference and speeding adaptation. I used the F plasmid to mediate recombination in the bacterium Escherichia coli and measured its effect on adaptation at high and low mutation rates. Recombination increased the rate of adaptation approximately 3-fold more in the high mutation rate treatment, where beneficial mutations had to compete for fixation. Sequencing of candidate loci revealed the presence of a beneficial mutation in six high mutation rate lines. In the absence of recombination, this mutation took longer to fix and, over the course of its substitution, conferred a reduced competitive advantage, indicating interference between competing beneficial mutations. Together, these results provide experimental support for the Fisher-Muller model and demonstrate that plasmid-mediated gene transfer can accelerate bacterial adaptation.},

Here we show that a precise mathematical analogy can be drawn between certain evolutionary and thermodynamic systems, allowing application of the powerful machinery of statistical physics to analysis of a family of evolutionary models. Analytical results that follow directly from this approach include the steady-state distribution of fixed genotypes and the load in finite populations. The analogy with statistical physics also reveals that, contrary to a basic tenet of the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution, the frequencies of adaptive and deleterious substitutions at steady state are equal. Finally, just as the free energy function quantitatively characterizes the balance between energy and entropy, a free fitness function provides an analytical expression for the balance between natural selection and stochastic drift.},

title = {Multiple HIV-1 introductions into the Swedish intravenous drug user population},
abstract = {In 2001, an increase of HIV-1 diagnoses among intravenous drug users (IVDU) was reported in Sweden. In nearby countries, Finland, Russia and the Baltic states, recent outbreaks had been described. Since there was a concern that these outbreaks would carry over to Sweden a study was initiated to determine the factors leading to the Swedish increase of HIV-1 diagnosed IVDUs. HIV-1 env V3 sequences were obtained from 97 patients enrolled in ongoing epidemiological studies encompassing the years 1987--2004 with a focus on 2001--2002. The sequences were used for maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference of the molecular epidemiology. Among the virus spreading in 2001--2002, we found that four different subtypes/CRFs were present in the Swedish IVDU population (A, B, CRF01_AE and CRF06_cpx). Subtype B constituted 85% of the infections, established by 12 independent introductions into the IVDU population. The worrisome increase in 2001 was mainly not a result of import of the outbreaks in nearby countries, but rather a higher detection rate of secondary cases due to efficient epidemiological tracing of the generally slow spread of established forms of subtype B in the IVDU community. However, a few of the non-subtype B cases were linked to the outbreaks in Finland, Estonia and Latvia. Because HIV-1 outbreaks can easily be exported from one country to another amongst IVDUs, this prompts continued surveillance in the Baltic Sea Region.},

abstract = {Human cancer cells typically harbour multiple chromosomal aberrations, nucleotide substitutions and epigenetic modifications that drive malignant transformation. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pilot project aims to assess the value of large-scale multi-dimensional analysis of these molecular characteristics in human cancer and to provide the data rapidly to the research community. Here we report the interim integrative analysis of DNA copy number, gene expression and DNA methylation aberrations in 206 glioblastomas--the most common type of adult brain cancer--and nucleotide sequence aberrations in 91 of the 206 glioblastomas. This analysis provides new insights into the roles of ERBB2, NF1 and TP53, uncovers frequent mutations of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase regulatory subunit gene PIK3R1, and provides a network view of the pathways altered in the development of glioblastoma. Furthermore, integration of mutation, DNA methylation and clinical treatment data reveals a link between MGMT promoter methylation and a hypermutator phenotype consequent to mismatch repair deficiency in treated glioblastomas, an observation with potential clinical implications. Together, these findings establish the feasibility and power of TCGA, demonstrating that it can rapidly expand knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer.},

title = {Deriving structure from evolution: metazoan segmentation},
abstract = {Segmentation is a common feature of disparate clades of metazoans, and its evolution is a central problem of evolutionary developmental biology. We evolved in silico regulatory networks by a mutation/selection process that just rewards the number of segment boundaries. For segmentation controlled by a static gradient, as in long-germ band insects, a cascade of adjacent repressors reminiscent of gap genes evolves. For sequential segmentation controlled by a moving gradient, similar to vertebrate somitogenesis, we invariably observe a very constrained evolutionary path or funnel. The evolved state is a cell autonomous 'clock and wavefront' model, with the new attribute of a separate bistable system driven by an autonomous clock. Early stages in the evolution of both modes of segmentation are functionally similar, and simulations suggest a possible path for their interconversion. Our computation illustrates how complex traits can evolve by the incremental addition of new functions on top of pre-existing traits.},

title = {Evolutionary potential of a duplicated repressor-operator pair: simulating pathways using mutation data},
abstract = {Ample evidence has accumulated for the evolutionary importance of duplication events. However, little is known about the ensuing step-by-step divergence process and the selective conditions that allow it to progress. Here we present a computational study on the divergence of two repressors after duplication. A central feature of our approach is that intermediate phenotypes can be quantified through the use of in vivo measured repression strengths of Escherichia coli lac mutants. Evolutionary pathways are constructed by multiple rounds of single base pair substitutions and selection for tight and independent binding. Our analysis indicates that when a duplicated repressor co-diverges together with its binding site, the fitness landscape allows funneling to a new regulatory interaction with early increases in fitness. We find that neutral mutations do not play an essential role, which is important for substantial divergence probabilities. By varying the selective pressure we can pinpoint the necessary ingredients for the observed divergence. Our findings underscore the importance of coevolutionary mechanisms in regulatory networks, and should be relevant for the evolution of protein-DNA as well as protein-protein interactions.},

title = {Perspective: sex, recombination, and the efficacy of selection--was Weismann right?},
abstract = {The idea that sex functions to provide variation for natural selection to act upon was first advocated by August Weismann and it has dominated much discussion on the evolution of sex and recombination since then. The goal of this paper is to further extend this hypothesis and to assess its place in a larger body of theory on the evolution of sex and recombination. A simple generic model is developed to show how fitness variation and covariation interact with selection for recombination and illustrate some important implications of the hypothesis: (1) the advantage of sex and recombination can accrue both to reproductively isolated populations and to modifiers segregating within populations, but the former will be much larger than the latter; (2) forces of degradation that are correlated across loci within an individual can reduce or reverse selection for increased recombination; and (3) crossing-over (which can occur at different places in different meioses) will create more variability than having multiple chromosomes and so will have more influence on the efficacy of selection. Several long-term selection experiments support Weismann's hypothesis, including those showing a greater response to selection in populations with higher rates of recombination and higher rates of recombination evolving as a correlated response to selection for some other character. Weismann's hypothesis is also consistent with the sporadic distribution of obligate asexuality, which indicates that clones have a higher rate of extinction than sexuals. Weismann's hypothesis is then discussed in light of other patterns in the distribution of sexuality versus asexuality. To account for variation in the frequency of obligate asexuality in different taxa, a simple model is developed in which this frequency is a function of three parameters: the rate of clonal origin, the initial fitness of clones when they arise, and the rate at which that fitness declines over time. Variation in all three parameters is likely to be important in explaining the distribution of obligate asexuality. Facultative asexuality also exists, and for this to be stable it seems there must be ecological differences between the sexual and asexual propagules as well as genetic differences. Finally, the timing of sex in cyclical parthenogens is most likely set to minimize the opportunity costs of sex. None of these patterns contradict Weismann's hypothesis, but they do show that many additional principles unrelated to the function of sex are required to fully explain its distribution. Weismann's hypothesis is also consistent with what we know about the mechanics and molecular genetics of recombination, in particular the tendency for chromatids to recombine with a homolog rather than a sister chromatid at meiosis, which is opposite to what they do during mitosis. However, molecular genetic studies have shown that cis-acting sites at which recombination is initiated are lost by gene conversion as a result, a factor that can be expected to affect many fine details in the evolution of recombination. In summary, although Weismann's hypothesis must be considered the leading candidate for the function of sex and recombination, nevertheless, many additional principles are needed to fully account for their evolution.},

In particular we find two recombination prone regions, "hot spots", located approximately either side of the envelope gene. To investigate this, we test whether there is a correlation between the distribution of the recombinant breakpoints with (1) genetic similarity, (2) predicted locations of secondary RNA structure, (3) regions identified as recombinant hot spots from experimental studies and (4) the predicted locations of positively selected sites. No detectable relationship with RNA secondary structure was found. A weak relationship with genetic similarity exists but it does not account for the recombination hot spots. The comparison with the published experimental studies indicated that the identified recombination hot spots differ in their locations, indicating that selection is having an impact on HIV-1 recombinant structures in infected individuals. We observe an association between recombination prone regions and strong positive selection across the envelope gene in support of this hypothesis.},

abstract = {Allele frequency differences across populations can provide valuable information both for studying population structure and for identifying loci that have been targets of natural selection. Here, we examine the relationship between recombination rate and population differentiation in humans by analyzing two uniformly-ascertained, whole-genome data sets. We find that population differentiation as assessed by inter-continental F(ST) shows negative correlation with recombination rate, with F(ST) reduced by 10% in the tenth of the genome with the highest recombination rate compared with the tenth of the genome with the lowest recombination rate (P<<10(-12)). This pattern cannot be explained by the mutagenic properties of recombination and instead must reflect the impact of selection in the last 100,000 years since human continental populations split. The correlation between recombination rate and F(ST) has a qualitatively different relationship for F(ST) between African and non-African populations and for F(ST) between European and East Asian populations, suggesting varying levels or types of selection in different epochs of human history.},

In humans, pedigree analysis has documented variation at the chromosomal level, and sperm studies have identified specific hotspots in which crossing-over events cluster. To address whether this picture is representative of the genome as a whole, we have developed and validated a method for estimating recombination rates from patterns of genetic variation. From extensive single-nucleotide polymorphism surveys in European and African populations, we find evidence for extreme local rate variation spanning four orders in magnitude, in which 50% of all recombination events take place in less than 10% of the sequence. We demonstrate that recombination hotspots are a ubiquitous feature of the human genome, occurring on average every 200 kilobases or less, but recombination occurs preferentially outside genes.},

title = {Objective comparison of protein structures: error-scaled difference distance matrices},
abstract = {Understanding of macromolecular function in many cases relies on the comparison of related structural models. Commonly used least-squares superposition methods suffer from bias introduced into the comparison process by the subjective choice of atoms employed for the superposition. Difference distance matrices are a more objective means of comparing structures as they do not depend on a particular superposition scheme. However, they suffer from very high noise originating from coordinate errors. Modern refinement programs allow the rigorous estimation of standard uncertainties for individual atomic positions. These errors can be propagated through the calculation of a difference distance matrix allowing one to assess the significance level of structural differences. An algorithm is presented which produces an intuitive graphical representation of difference distance matrices after normalization to their error levels. Two examples where its application was revealing are described. Alternatives are suggested for cases where rigorous estimation of individual errors by the inversion of the full least-squares matrix is not feasible. The method offers an unbiased way to detect significant similarities and differences between related structures, as encountered in studies of complexes and mutants or when multiple models are obtained from experiments such as crystal structures involving non-crystallographic symmetry or different crystal modifications, or ensembles derived from NMR spectroscopy.},

Using periodicity and correlation algorithms, we identified 800 genes that meet an objective minimum criterion for cell cycle regulation. In separate experiments, designed to examine the effects of inducing either the G1 cyclin Cln3p or the B-type cyclin Clb2p, we found that the mRNA levels of more than half of these 800 genes respond to one or both of these cyclins.

abstract = {The evolutionary interaction between influenza A virus and the human immune system, manifest as 'antigenic drift' of the viral haemagglutinin, is one of the best described patterns in molecular evolution. However, little is known about the genome-scale evolutionary dynamics of this pathogen. Similarly, how genomic processes relate to global influenza epidemiology, in which the A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 subtypes co-circulate, is poorly understood. Here through an analysis of 1,302 complete viral genomes sampled from temperate populations in both hemispheres, we show that the genomic evolution of influenza A virus is characterized by a complex interplay between frequent reassortment and periodic selective sweeps. The A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 subtypes exhibit different evolutionary dynamics, with diverse lineages circulating in A/H1N1, indicative of weaker antigenic drift. These results suggest a sink-source model of viral ecology in which new lineages are seeded from a persistent influenza reservoir, which we hypothesize to be located in the tropics, to sink populations in temperate regions.},

title = {Multiply infected spleen cells in {HIV} patients},
abstract = {The genome of the human immunodeficiency virus is highly prone to recombination, although it is not obvious whether recombinants arise infrequently or whether they are constantly being spawned but escape identification because of the massive and rapid turnover of virus particles. Here we use fluorescence in situ hybridization to estimate the number of proviruses harboured by individual splenocytes from two HIV patients, and determine the extent of recombination by sequencing amplified DNA from these cells. We find an average of three or four proviruses per cell and evidence for huge numbers of recombinants and extensive genetic variation. Although this creates problems for phylogenetic analyses, which ignore recombination effects, the intracellular variation may help to broaden immune recognition.},

title = {Applying spectral fingerprinting to the analysis of FRET images},
abstract = {F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) allows one to study interactions between two fluorescently labeled molecules (donors and acceptors) at distances on the order of 5 nm. Many studies have described methods of how to measure the efficiency of FRET. However, few have addressed the question of how fluorescence from unpaired donors and acceptors can be determined in addition to that from FRET-pairs and how the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of such estimates depends on the presence of the partner species. Such knowledge, however, is essential for many biological applications, in which-after initial characterization of the spectral properties of a well-defined donor-acceptor complex-the in vivo affinity and stoichiometry of the complex is of interest. Here, we provide a theoretical analysis on how spectral fingerprinting can be applied to separate fluorescence of FRET pairs from that originating from unpaired donors and acceptors and how to select imaging parameters to optimize the SNR of the estimates. Thereby, we uncover a fundamental problem in this application and discuss ways to evade its adverse consequences. We compare the expected resolution of traditional FRET measures with that of optimized spectral fingerprinting and analyze the resolution of a method for FRET measurements that combines spectral with fluorescence lifetime information.},

title = {Perturbation analysis of a two-locus model with directional selection and recombination},
abstract = {A population genetic two-locus model with additive, directional selection and recombination is considered. It is assumed that recombination is weaker than selection; i.e., the recombination parameter r is smaller than the selection coefficients. This assumption is appropriate for describing the effects of two-locus selection at the molecular level. The model is formulated in terms of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the gamete frequencies x = (x1, x2, x3, x4), defined on the simplex S4. The ODEs are analyzed using first a regular perturbation technique. However, this approach yields satisfactory results only if r is very small relative to the selection coefficients and if the initial values x(0) are in the interior part of S4. To cope with this problem, a novel two-scale perturbation method is proposed which rests on the theory of averaging of vectorfields. It is demonstrated that the zeroth-order solution of this two-scale approach approximates the numerical solution of the model well, even if recombination rate is on the order of the selection coefficients.},

abstract = {In this article we explore statistical properties of the maximum-likelihood estimates (MLEs) of the selection and mutation parameters in a Poisson random field population genetics model of directional selection at DNA sites. We derive the asymptotic variances and covariance of the MLEs and explore the power of the likelihood ratio tests (LRT) of neutrality for varying levels of mutation and selection as well as the robustness of the LRT to deviations from the assumption of free recombination among sites. We also discuss the coverage of confidence intervals on the basis of two standard-likelihood methods. We find that the LRT has high power to detect deviations from neutrality and that the maximum-likelihood estimation performs very well when the ancestral states of all mutations in the sample are known. When the ancestral states are not known, the test has high power to detect deviations from neutrality for negative selection but not for positive selection. We also find that the LRT is not robust to deviations from the assumption of independence among sites.},

Although originally based on first principles, this claim is now empirically well supported: numerous studies have identified cis-regulatory mutations with functionally significant consequences for morphology, physiology and behaviour. The focus has now shifted to considering whether cis-regulatory and coding mutations make qualitatively different contributions to phenotypic evolution. Cases in which parallel mutations have produced parallel trait modifications in particular suggest that some phenotypic changes are more likely to result from cis-regulatory mutations than from coding mutations.},

title = {Fitness flux and ubiquity of adaptive evolution},
abstract = {Natural selection favors fitter variants in a population, but actual evolutionary processes may decrease fitness by mutations and genetic drift. How is the stochastic evolution of molecular biological systems shaped by natural selection? Here, we derive a theorem on the fitness flux in a population, defined as the selective effect of its genotype frequency changes. The fitness-flux theorem generalizes Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection to evolutionary processes including mutations, genetic drift, and time-dependent selection. It shows that a generic state of populations is adaptive evolution: there is a positive fitness flux resulting from a surplus of beneficial over deleterious changes. In particular, stationary nonequilibrium evolution processes are predicted to be adaptive. Under specific nonstationary conditions, notably during a decrease in population size, the average fitness flux can become negative. We show that these predictions are in accordance with experiments in bacteria and bacteriophages and with genomic data in Drosophila. Our analysis establishes fitness flux as a universal measure of adaptation in molecular evolution.},

abstract = {We describe the Phase II HapMap, which characterizes over 3.1 million human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in 270 individuals from four geographically diverse populations and includes 25-35% of common SNP variation in the populations surveyed. The map is estimated to capture untyped common variation with an average maximum r2 of between 0.9 and 0.96 depending on population. We demonstrate that the current generation of commercial genome-wide genotyping products captures common Phase II SNPs with an average maximum r2 of up to 0.8 in African and up to 0.95 in non-African populations, and that potential gains in power in association studies can be obtained through imputation. These data also reveal novel aspects of the structure of linkage disequilibrium. We show that 10-30% of pairs of individuals within a population share at least one region of extended genetic identity arising from recent ancestry and that up to 1% of all common variants are untaggable, primarily because they lie within recombination hotspots. We show that recombination rates vary systematically around genes and between genes of different function. Finally, we demonstrate increased differentiation at non-synonymous, compared to synonymous, SNPs, resulting from systematic differences in the strength or efficacy of natural selection between populations.},

title = {Perspective: Here's to Fisher, additive genetic variance, and the fundamental theorem of natural selection},
abstract = {Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection, that the rate of change of fitness is given by the additive genetic variance of fitness, has generated much discussion since its appearance in 1930. Fisher tried to capture in the formula the change in population fitness attributable to changes of allele frequencies, when all else is not included. Lessard's formulation comes closest to Fisher's intention, as well as this can be judged. Additional terms can be added to account for other changes. The "theorem" as stated by Fisher is not exact, and therefore not a theorem, but it does encapsulate a great deal of evolutionary meaning in a simple statement. I also discuss the effectiveness of reproductive-value weighting and the theorem in integrated form. Finally, an optimum principle, analogous to least action and Hamilton's principle in physics, is discussed.},

title = {The genetic architecture of quantitative traits},
abstract = {Phenotypic variation for quantitative traits results from the segregation of alleles at multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL) with effects that are sensitive to the genetic, sexual, and external environments. Major challenges for biology in the post-genome era are to map the molecular polymorphisms responsible for variation in medically, agriculturally, and evolutionarily important complex traits; and to determine their gene frequencies and their homozygous, heterozygous, epistatic, and pleiotropic effects in multiple environments. The ease with which QTL can be mapped to genomic intervals bounded by molecular markers belies the difficulty in matching the QTL to a genetic locus. The latter requires high-resolution recombination or linkage disequilibrium mapping to nominate putative candidate genes, followed by genetic and/or functional complementation and gene expression analyses. Complete genome sequences and improved technologies for polymorphism detection will greatly advance the genetic dissection of quantitative traits in model organisms, which will open avenues for exploration of homologous QTL in related taxa.},

abstract = {Copy number variation is surprisingly common among humans and can be involved in phenotypic diversity and variable susceptibility to complex diseases, but little is known of the extent of copy number variation in nonhuman primates. We have used two array-based comparative genomic hybridization platforms to identify a total of 355 copy number variants (CNVs) in the genomes of 20 wild-born chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and have compared the identified chimpanzee CNVs to known human CNVs from previous studies. Many CNVs were observed in the corresponding regions in both chimpanzees and humans; especially those CNVs of higher frequency. Strikingly, these loci are enriched 20-fold for ancestral segmental duplications, which may facilitate CNV formation through nonallelic homologous recombination mechanisms. Therefore, some of these regions may be unstable "hotspots" for the genesis of copy number variation, with recurrent duplications and deletions occurring across and within species.},

title = {Cost of host radiation in an RNA virus},
abstract = {Although host radiation allows a parasite to expand its ecological niche, traits governing the infection of multiple host types can decrease fitness in the original or alternate host environments. Reasons for this reduction in fitness include slower replication due to added genetic material or modifications, fitness trade-offs across host environments, and weaker selection resulting from simultaneous adaptation to multiple habitats. We examined the consequences of host radiation using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and mammalian host cells in tissue culture. Replicate populations of VSV were allowed to evolve for 100 generations on the original host (BHK cells), on either of two novel hosts (HeLa and MDCK cells), or in environments where the availability of novel hosts fluctuated in a predictable or random way. As expected, each experimental population showed a substantial fitness gain in its own environment, but those evolved on new hosts (constant or fluctuating) suffered reduced competitiveness on the original host. However, whereas evolution on one novel host negatively correlated with performance on the unselected novel host, adaptation in fluctuating environments led to fitness improvements in both novel habitats.},

title = {Chromosomal rearrangement inferred from comparisons of 12 Drosophila genomes},
abstract = {The availability of 12 complete genomes of various species of genus Drosophila provides a unique opportunity to analyze genome-scale chromosomal rearrangements among a group of closely related species. This article reports on the comparison of gene order between these 12 species and on the fixed rearrangement events that disrupt gene order. Three major themes are addressed: the conservation of syntenic blocks across species, the disruption of syntenic blocks (via chromosomal inversion events) and its relationship to the phylogenetic distribution of these species, and the rate of rearrangement events over evolutionary time. Comparison of syntenic blocks across this large genomic data set confirms that genetic elements are largely (95%) localized to the same Muller element across genus Drosophila species and paracentric inversions serve as the dominant mechanism for shuffling the order of genes along a chromosome. Gene-order scrambling between species is in accordance with the estimated evolutionary distances between them and we find it to approximate a linear process over time (linear to exponential with alternate divergence time estimates). We find the distribution of synteny segment sizes to be biased by a large number of small segments with comparatively fewer large segments. Our results provide estimated chromosomal evolution rates across this set of species on the basis of whole-genome synteny analysis, which are found to be higher than those previously reported. Identification of conserved syntenic blocks across these genomes suggests a large number of conserved blocks with varying levels of embryonic expression correlation in Drosophila melanogaster. On the other hand, an analysis of the disruption of syntenic blocks between species allowed the identification of fixed inversion breakpoints and estimates of breakpoint reuse and lineage-specific breakpoint event segregation.},

title = {The {Hill-Robertson} effect and the evolution of recombination},
abstract = {In finite populations, genetic drift generates interference between selected loci, causing advantageous alleles to be found more often on different chromosomes than on the same chromosome, which reduces the rate of adaptation. This "Hill-Robertson effect" generates indirect selection to increase recombination rates. We present a new method to quantify the strength of this selection. Our model represents a new beneficial allele (A) entering a population as a single copy, while another beneficial allele (B) is sweeping at another locus. A third locus affects the recombination rate between selected loci. Using a branching process model, we calculate the probability distribution of the number of copies of A on the different genetic backgrounds, after it is established but while it is still rare. Then, we use a deterministic model to express the change in frequency of the recombination modifier, due to hitchhiking, as A goes to fixation. We show that this method can give good estimates of selection for recombination. Moreover, it shows that recombination is selected through two different effects: it increases the fixation probability of new alleles, and it accelerates selective sweeps. The relative importance of these two effects depends on the relative times of occurrence of the beneficial alleles.},

abstract = {With the advent of dense maps of human genetic variation, it is now possible to detect positive natural selection across the human genome. Here we report an analysis of over 3 million polymorphisms from the International HapMap Project Phase 2 (HapMap2). We used 'long-range haplotype' methods, which were developed to identify alleles segregating in a population that have undergone recent selection, and we also developed new methods that are based on cross-population comparisons to discover alleles that have swept to near-fixation within a population. The analysis reveals more than 300 strong candidate regions. Focusing on the strongest 22 regions, we develop a heuristic for scrutinizing these regions to identify candidate targets of selection. In a complementary analysis, we identify 26 non-synonymous, coding, single nucleotide polymorphisms showing regional evidence of positive selection. Examination of these candidates highlights three cases in which two genes in a common biological process have apparently undergone positive selection in the same population:LARGE and DMD, both related to infection by the Lassa virus, in West Africa;SLC24A5 and SLC45A2, both involved in skin pigmentation, in Europe; and EDAR and EDA2R, both involved in development of hair follicles, in Asia.},

title = {Sympatric speciation in Nicaraguan crater lake cichlid fish},
abstract = {Sympatric speciation, the formation of species in the absence of geographical barriers, remains one of the most contentious concepts in evolutionary biology. Although speciation under sympatric conditions seems theoretically possible, empirical studies are scarce and only a few credible examples of sympatric speciation exist. Here we present a convincing case of sympatric speciation in the Midas cichlid species complex (Amphilophus sp.) in a young and small volcanic crater lake in Nicaragua. Our study includes phylogeographic, population-genetic (based on mitochondrial DNA, microsatellites and amplified fragment length polymorphisms), morphometric and ecological analyses. We find, first, that crater Lake Apoyo was seeded only once by the ancestral high-bodied benthic species Amphilophus citrinellus, the most common cichlid species in the area; second, that a new elongated limnetic species (Amphilophus zaliosus) evolved in Lake Apoyo from the ancestral species (A. citrinellus) within less than approximately 10,000 yr; third, that the two species in Lake Apoyo are reproductively isolated; and fourth, that the two species are eco-morphologically distinct.},

title = {The additive genetic variance after bottlenecks is affected by the number of loci involved in epistatic interactions},
abstract = {We investigated the role of the number of loci coding for a neutral trait on the release of additive variance for this trait after population bottlenecks. Different bottleneck sizes and durations were tested for various matrices of genotypic values, with initial conditions covering the allele frequency space. We used three different types of matrices. First, we extended Cheverud and Routman's model by defining matrices of "pure" epistasis for three and four independent loci; second, we used genotypic values drawn randomly from uniform, normal, and exponential distributions; and third we used two models of simple metabolic pathways leading to physiological epistasis. For all these matrices of genotypic values except the dominant metabolic pathway, we find that, as the number of loci increases from two to three and four, an increase in the release of additive variance is occurring. The amount of additive variance released for a given set of genotypic values is a function of the inbreeding coefficient, independently of the size and duration of the bottleneck. The level of inbreeding necessary to achieve maximum release in additive variance increases with the number of loci. We find that additive-by-additive epistasis is the type of epistasis most easily converted into additive variance. For a wide range of models, our results show that epistasis, rather than dominance, plays a significant role in the increase of additive variance following bottlenecks.},

This behavior is not present in populations evolving asexually without recombination and is thus important in any comparison of sexual and asexual populations. In order to calculate the details of the phase transition, we use techniques from statistical physics. We introduce the correlation of the population as the order parameter of the system and use maximum entropy inference to find the state of the population at any time.},

abstract = {Competition between random genetic drift and natural selection play a central role in evolution: Whereas nonbeneficial mutations often prevail in small populations by chance, mutations that sweep through large populations typically confer a selective advantage. Here, however, we observe chance effects during range expansions that dramatically alter the gene pool even in large microbial populations. Initially well mixed populations of two fluorescently labeled strains of Escherichia coli develop well defined, sector-like regions with fractal boundaries in expanding colonies. The formation of these regions is driven by random fluctuations that originate in a thin band of pioneers at the expanding frontier. A comparison of bacterial and yeast colonies (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) suggests that this large-scale genetic sectoring is a generic phenomenon that may provide a detectable footprint of past range expansions.},

abstract = {The mutational deterministic hypothesis for the origin and maintenance of sexual reproduction posits that sex enhances the ability of natural selection to purge deleterious mutations after recombination brings them together into single genomes. This explanation requires negative epistasis, a type of genetic interaction where mutations are more harmful in combination than expected from their separate effects. The conceptual appeal of the mutational deterministic hypothesis has been offset by our inability to identify the mechanistic and evolutionary bases of negative epistasis. Here we show that negative epistasis can evolve as a consequence of sexual reproduction itself. Using an artificial gene network model, we find that recombination between gene networks imposes selection for genetic robustness, and that negative epistasis evolves as a by-product of this selection. Our results suggest that sexual reproduction selects for conditions that favour its own maintenance, a case of evolution forging its own path.},

title = {High efficiency of HIV-1 genomic RNA packaging and heterozygote formation revealed by single virion analysis},
abstract = {A long-standing question in retrovirus biology is how RNA genomes are distributed among virions. In the studies presented in this report, we addressed this issue by directly examining HIV-1 RNAs in virions using a modified HIV-1 genome that contained recognition sites for BglG, an antitermination protein in the Escherichia coli bgl operon, which was coexpressed with a fragment of BglG RNA binding protein fused to a fluorescent protein. Our results demonstrate that the majority of virions (>90%) contain viral RNAs. We also coexpressed HIV-1 genomes containing binding sites for BglG or the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein along with 2 fluorescent protein-tagged RNA binding proteins. This method allows simultaneously labeling and discrimination of 2 different RNAs at single-RNA-detection sensitivity. Using this strategy, we obtained physical evidence that virions contain RNAs derived from different parental viruses (heterozygous virion) at ratios expected from a random distribution, and we found that this ratio can be altered by changing the dimerization sequences. Our studies of heterozygous virions also support a generally accepted but unproven assumption that most particles contain 1 dimer. This study provides answers to long-standing questions in HIV-1 biology and illustrates the power and sensitivity of the 2-RNA labeling method, which can also be adapted to analyze various issues of RNA biogenesis including the detection of different RNAs in live cell imaging.},

abstract = {Epistasis is a pervasive phenomenon in biology. Nevertheless, attempts at identifying epistatic interactions with quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses have yielded inconsistent results. In this study, we attempt to determine the genetic control of outbreeding depression and the possible role of epistasis following a wide cross in common bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris L.). A recombinant inbred population, derived from a cross between Andean and Mesoamerican common bean cultivars, was evaluated in two markedly contrasting environments. A low-density linkage map based on AFLPs was used to locate QTLs for the number of days to maturity, average daily biomass and seed yield accumulation, and harvest index. Both independently acting and digenic epistatic QTLs of similar magnitude were identified. A majority of the loci involved in these epistatic interactions did not have an independent effect. Although we did find evidence for strong epistatic control of the traits investigated, we also found, in contrast to other recent studies, that there was no evidence for a bias toward coadapted gene complexes at the level of digenic epistasis. We discuss these results in relation to the role of epistasis in the evolutionary history of the species and methodological difficulties in detecting epistasis.},

Despite their high variability in time, some of them exhibit quite low variability within the population at any given time, a somehow paradoxical behavior often called the evolving quasispecies. In this paper we introduce a simplified model of an evolving viral population in which the effects of the acquired immunity of the host are represented by the decrease of the fitness of the corresponding viral strains, depending on the frequency of the strain in the viral population. The model exhibits evolving quasispecies behavior in a certain range of its parameters, ans suggests how punctuated evolution can be induced by a simple feedback mechanism. },

title = {A coalescent-based method for detecting and estimating recombination from gene sequences},
abstract = {Determining the amount of recombination in the genealogical history of a sample of genes is important to both evolutionary biology and medical population genetics. However, recurrent mutation can produce patterns of genetic diversity similar to those generated by recombination and can bias estimates of the population recombination rate. Hudson 2001 has suggested an approximate-likelihood method based on coalescent theory to estimate the population recombination rate, 4N(e)r, under an infinite-sites model of sequence evolution. Here we extend the method to the estimation of the recombination rate in genomes, such as those of many viruses and bacteria, where the rate of recurrent mutation is high. In addition, we develop a powerful permutation-based method for detecting recombination that is both more powerful than other permutation-based methods and robust to misspecification of the model of sequence evolution. We apply the method to sequence data from viruses, bacteria, and human mitochondrial DNA. The extremely high level of recombination detected in both HIV1 and HIV2 sequences demonstrates that recombination cannot be ignored in the analysis of viral population genetic data.},

abstract = {Abstract: We present a quantitative genetic (QG) interpretation of the Bateson‐Dobzhansky‐Muller (BDM) genetic model of speciation in order to unify the theoretical framework for understanding how the genetic differentiation of populations is associated with the process of speciation. Specifically, we compare the QG theory of joint scaling with the Turelli‐Orr mathematical formulation of the BDM model. By formally linking the two models, we show that a wealth of empirical methods from QG can be brought to bear on the study of the genetic architecture of hybrid phenotypes to better understand the connections, if any, between microevolution within populations and macroevolution in the origin of species. By integrating the two theories, we make additional novel predictions that enrich the opportunities for empirically testing speciation genetic theory or facets of it, such as Haldane's rule. We show that the connection between the two theories is simple and straightforward for autosomal genes but not for sex...},

title = {Influence of random genetic drift on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 env evolution during chronic infection},
abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has high replication and mutation rates that generate large census populations and high levels of genetic variation. We examined the roles of natural selection, population growth, random genetic drift, and recombination in shaping the variation in 1509 C2-V5 env sequences derived from nine men with chronic HIV-1 infection. These sequences were obtained from clinical visits that reflect the first 6-13.7 years of infection. Pairwise comparisons of nonsynonymous and synonymous distances, Tajima's D test, Fu and Li's D* test, and a test of recurrent mutation revealed evidence for episodes of nonneutral evolution in a total of 22 out of 145 blood samples, representing six of the nine individuals. Using three coalescent-based maximum-likelihood estimators, we found viral effective population sizes in all nine individuals to be approximately 10(3). We also show that a previous estimate of the effective population size of approximately 10(5) based on rare haplotype frequencies decreases to approximately 10(3) upon correcting a biased sampling procedure. We conclude that the genetic variation in these data sets can be explained by a predominance of random genetic drift of neutral mutations with brief episodes of natural selection that were frequently masked by recombination.},

A SNP in the human MDM2 gene (SNP309 T/G) occurs at frequencies dependent on demographic history and has been shown to have important differential effects on the activity of the MDM2 and p53 proteins and to associate with altered risk for the development of several cancers. In this report, the haplotype structure of the MDM2 gene is determined by using 14 different SNPs across the gene from three different population samples: Caucasians, African Americans, and the Ashkenazi Jewish ethnic group. The results presented in this report indicate that there is a substantially reduced variability of the deleterious SNP309 G allele haplotype in all three populations studied, whereas multiple common T allele haplotypes were found in all three populations. This observation, coupled with the relatively high frequency of the G allele haplotype in both and Caucasian and Ashkenazi Jewish population data sets, suggests that this haplotype could have undergone a recent positive selection sweep. An entropy-based selection test is presented that explicitly takes into account the correlations between different SNPs, and the analysis of MDM2 reveals a significant departure from the standard assumptions of selective neutrality.},

title = {Modelled in vivo HIV fitness under drug selective pressure and estimated genetic barrier towards resistance are predictive for virological response},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: A method has been developed to estimate a fitness landscape experienced by HIV-1 under treatment selective pressure as a function of the genotypic sequence thereby also estimating the genetic barrier to resistance. METHODS: We evaluated the performance of two estimated fitness landscapes (nelfinavir [NFV] and zidovudine [AZT] plus lamivudine [3TC]) to predict week 12 viral load (VL) change for 176 treatment change episodes (TCEs) and probability of week 48 virological failure for 90 TCEs, in treatment experienced patients starting these drugs in combination. RESULTS: A higher genetic barrier for AZT plus 3TC, (quantified per additional mutation required to develop resistance against these drugs) was associated with a 0.54 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.30-0.77) larger log10 VL reduction at 12 weeks (P < 0.0001) and a 0.39 (95%/ CI 0.23-0.66) lower odds of virological failure at 48 weeks (P = 0.0005), in analyses adjusting for the pre-TCE VL and the exact time-lag between the TCE and the date of determining response VL. The strength of these associations was comparable with those seen with expert interpretation systems (Rega, ANRS and HIVDB). A higher genetic barrier to NFV resistance was the only genotypic predictor that tended to be associated with a 0.19 (95% CI 0-0.39) higher log10 VL reduction at 12 weeks (P = 0.05) and a 0.63 (95% CI 0.36-1.09) lower odds of virological failure at 48 weeks ( P = 0.10) per additional mutation. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that an estimated genetic barrier derived from fitness landscapes may contribute to an improvement of predicted treatment outcome for NFV and this approach should be explored for other drugs.},

abstract = {The number of selectively neutral polymorphic sites in a random sample of genes can be affected by ancestral selectively favored substitutions at linked loci. The degree to which this happens depends on when in the history of the sample the selected substitutions happen, the strength of selection and the amount of crossing over between the sampled locus and the loci at which the selected substitutions occur. This phenomenon is commonly called hitchhiking. Using the coalescent process for a random sample of genes from a selectively neutral locus that is linked to a locus at which selection is taking place, a stochastic, finite population model is developed that describes the steady state effect of hitchhiking on the distribution of the number of selectively neutral polymorphic sites in a random sample. A prediction of the model is that, in regions of low crossing over, strongly selected substitutions in the history of the sample can substantially reduce the number of polymorphic sites in a random sample of genes from that expected under a neutral model.},

abstract = {The tendency for genetic architectures to exhibit epistasis among mutations plays a central role in the modern synthesis of evolutionary biology and in theoretical descriptions of many evolutionary processes. Nevertheless, few studies unquestionably show whether, and how, mutations typically interact. Beneficial mutations are especially difficult to identify because of their scarcity. Consequently, epistasis among pairs of this important class of mutations has, to our knowledge, never before been explored. Interactions among genome components should be of special relevance in compacted genomes such as those of RNA viruses. To tackle these issues, we first generated 47 genotypes of vesicular stomatitis virus carrying pairs of nucleotide substitution mutations whose separated and combined deleterious effects on fitness were determined. Several pairs exhibited significant interactions for fitness, including antagonistic and synergistic epistasis. Synthetic lethals represented 50% of the latter. In a second set of experiments, 15 genotypes carrying pairs of beneficial mutations were also created. In this case, all significant interactions were antagonistic. Our results show that the architecture of the fitness depends on complex interactions among genome components.},

Here, we study evolution where fitness itself is stochastic, with random switches in the direction of selection at individual genomic loci. As the correlation time of these fluctuations becomes larger than the diffusion time of mutations within the population, fitness changes from an annealed to a quenched random variable. We show that the rate of evolution has its maximum in the crossover regime, where both time scales are comparable. Adaptive evolution emerges in the quenched fitness regime (evidence for such fitness fluctuations has recently been found in genomic data). The joint statistical theory of reproductive and fitness fluctuations establishes a conceptual connection between evolutionary genetics and statistical physics of disordered systems.},

title = {The speed of adaptation in large asexual populations},
abstract = {In large asexual populations, beneficial mutations have to compete with each other for fixation. Here, I derive explicit analytic expressions for the rate of substitution and the mean beneficial effect of fixed mutations, under the assumptions that the population size N is large, that the mean effect of new beneficial mutations is smaller than the mean effect of new deleterious mutations, and that new beneficial mutations are exponentially distributed. As N increases, the rate of substitution approaches a constant, which is equal to the mean effect of new beneficial mutations. The mean effect of fixed mutations continues to grow logarithmically with N. The speed of adaptation, measured as the change of log fitness over time, also grows logarithmically with N for moderately large N, and it grows double-logarithmically for extremely large N. Moreover, I derive a simple formula that determines whether at given N beneficial mutations are expected to compete with each other or go to fixation independently. Finally, I verify all results with numerical simulations.},

title = {Compensatory mutations cause excess of antagonistic epistasis in RNA secondary structure folding},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The rate at which fitness declines as an organism's genome accumulates random mutations is an important variable in several evolutionary theories. At an intuitive level, it might seem natural that random mutations should tend to interact synergistically, such that the rate of mean fitness decline accelerates as the number of random mutations is increased. However, in a number of recent studies, a prevalence of antagonistic epistasis (the tendency of multiple mutations to have a mitigating rather than reinforcing effect) has been observed. RESULTS: We studied in silico the net amount and form of epistatic interactions in RNA secondary structure folding by measuring the fraction of neutral mutants as a function of mutational distance d. We found a clear prevalence of antagonistic epistasis in RNA secondary structure folding. By relating the fraction of neutral mutants at distance d to the average neutrality at distance d, we showed that this prevalence derives from the existence of many compensatory mutations at larger mutational distances. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings imply that the average direction of epistasis in simple fitness landscapes is directly related to the density with which fitness peaks are distributed in these landscapes.},

title = {Clonal interference, multiple mutations and adaptation in large asexual populations},
abstract = {Two important problems affect the ability of asexual populations to accumulate beneficial mutations and hence to adapt. First, clonal interference causes some beneficial mutations to be outcompeted by more-fit mutations that occur in the same genetic background. Second, multiple mutations occur in some individuals, so even mutations of large effect can be outcompeted unless they occur in a good genetic background that contains other beneficial mutations. In this article, we use a Monte Carlo simulation to study how these two factors influence the adaptation of asexual populations. We find that the results depend qualitatively on the shape of the distribution of the fitness effects of possible beneficial mutations. When this distribution falls off slower than exponentially, clonal interference alone reasonably describes which mutations dominate the adaptation, although it gives a misleading picture of the evolutionary dynamics. When the distribution falls off faster than exponentially, an analysis based on multiple mutations is more appropriate. Using our simulations, we are able to explore the limits of validity of both of these approaches, and we explore the complex dynamics in the regimes where neither one is fully applicable.},

title = {Contribution of recombination to the evolution of human immunodeficiency viruses expressing resistance to antiretroviral treatment},
abstract = {Viral recombination has been postulated to play two roles in the development of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) resistance to antiretroviral drugs. First, recombination has the capacity to associate resistance mutations expressed by distinct viruses, thereby contributing to the development of viruses with improved drug resistance. In addition, recombination could preserve diversity in regions outside those subject to strong selective pressure. In this study, we sought direct evidence for the occurrence of these processes in vivo by evaluating clonal virus populations obtained from the same patient before and after a treatment change that, while unsuccessful in controlling viral replication, led to the emergence of viruses expressing a different profile of resistance mutations. Phylogenetic studies supported the conclusion that the genotype arising after the treatment change resulted from the emergence of recombinant viruses carrying previously existing resistance mutations in novel combinations, whereas alternative explanations, including convergent evolution, were not consistent with observed genotypic changes. Despite evidence for a strong loss of genetic diversity in genomic regions coding for the protease and reverse transcriptase, diversity in regions coding for Gag and envelope was considerably higher, and recombination between the emerging viruses expressing the new pattern of resistance mutations and viral quasispecies in the previously dominant population contributed to this preservation of diversity in the envelope gene. These findings emphasize that recombination can participate in the adaptation of HIV to changing selective pressure, both by generating novel combinations of resistance mutations and by maintaining diversity in genomic regions outside those implicated in a selective sweep.},

More precisely, we investigate the problem of sorting signed permutations by reversals without breaking common intervals. We describe a combinatorial framework for this problem that allows us to characterize classes of signed permutations for which one can compute, in polynomial time, a shortest reversal scenario that conserves all common intervals. In particular, we define a class of permutations for which this computation can be done in linear time with a very simple algorithm that does not rely on the classical Hannenhalli-Pevzner theory for sorting by reversals. We apply these methods to the computation of rearrangement scenarios between permutations obtained from 16 synteny blocks of the X chromosomes of the human, mouse, and rat.},

A variety of statistical models and inference techniques have been developed to reconstruct the HIV evolutionary history and to investigate the population genetic processes that shape viral diversity. Remarkably different population genetic forces are at work within and among hosts. Population-level HIV phylogenies are mainly shaped by selectively neutral epidemiologic processes, implying that genealogy-based population genetic inference can be useful to study the HIV epidemic history. Such evolutionary analyses have shed light on the origins of HIV, and on the epidemic spread of viral variants in different geographic locations and in different populations. The HIV genealogies reconstructed from within-host sequences indicate the action of selection pressure. In addition, recombination has a significant impact on HIV genetic diversity. Accurately quantifying both the adaptation rate and the population recombination rate of HIV will contribute to a better understanding of immune escape and drug resistance. Characterizing the impact of HIV transmission on viral genetic diversity will be a key factor in reconciling the different population genetic processes within and among hosts.},

Interacting loci have been identified in many organisms. However, the prevalence of interactions, and the nucleotide changes underlying them, are largely unknown. Here we search for naturally occurring genetic interactions in a large set of quantitative phenotypes--the levels of all transcripts in a cross between two strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For each transcript, we searched for secondary loci interacting with primary QTLs detected by their individual effects. Such locus pairs were estimated to be involved in the inheritance of 57% of transcripts; statistically significant pairs were identified for 225 transcripts. Among these, 67% of secondary loci had individual effects too small to be significant in a genome-wide scan. Engineered polymorphisms in isogenic strains confirmed an interaction between the mating-type locus MAT and the pheromone response gene GPA1. Our results indicate that genetic interactions are widespread in the genetics of transcript levels, and that many QTLs will be missed by single-locus tests but can be detected by two-stage tests that allow for interactions.},

Our analytic results are used to predict levels of variation for the entire third chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster. The predictions are consistent with the low levels of variation that have been observed at loci near the centromeres of the third chromosome of D. melanogaster. However, the low levels of variation observed near the tips of this chromosome are not predicted using currently available estimates of the deleterious mutation rate and of selection coefficients. If considerably smaller selection coefficients are assumed, the low observed levels of variation at the tips of the third chromosome are consistent with the background selection model.},

journal = {The American Naturalist},
title = {Evolution of Niche Width},
abstract = {A model is developed to predict evolution in a population which contains a variety of ecologically specialized phenotypes. Individuals of each phenotype are assumed to specialize on a specific region of a resource axis present in the environment. The model, incorporating density-dependent effects on the fitness of the various phenotypes, predicts the number of individuals of each phenotype through time for both asexually and sexually reproducing populations. The lizard species, Anolis roquet, illustrates the kind of population treated by the model. The resource axis is prey size; small lizards preferentially utilize small prey, while large lizards exploit large prey. Field data on this species are used to estimate some of the parameters of the model. The model shows that there is an optimum number of individuals of each phenotype for a given set of resources and a given regime of interphenotypic competition. If the population has this optimum distribution of individuals, then the fitnesses of all phenotypes are equal and the largest population size is achieved. Any other distribution yields too many individuals of certain kinds and too few of others, and a smaller total population size. The model is solved analytically to characterize this optimum distribution thoroughly. The model also shows that an asexually reproducing population, provided it has enough genetic variability, attains the optimum distribution very rapidly, while a sexually reproducing population attains the optimum distribution only slowly if at all. As a result, the sexual population often suffers from overcrowding in some phenotypic classes and undercrowding in others, and has a lower population size. The reason a sexual population may not attain the optimum distribution is that there is always a direct relationship between the shape of the distribution of phenotypes in the whole population and the shape of the distribution of phenotypes among the offspring of each mating within the population. In particular, the variance in the population's phenotype distribution is always approximately twice the variance in the offspring phenotype distribution. Therefore, if a sexual population is to attain the optimum population distribution, its offspring distribution must have a certain shape. Natural selection will mold the offspring distribution to this special shape, but presumably this molding takes a very long time. If this is true, a sexual population in a new or changed environment attains the optimum population phenotype distribution much more slowly than an asexual population. The niche width of a population is the length of the interval on the resource axis from which the population obtains most (say 95%) of its resources. There are two components to niche width: the within-phenotype component, which is due to the variety of resources used by each phenotype, and the between-phenotype component, which is due to the population's having a variety of phenotypes. The model summarized above concerns the evolution in asexual and sexual populations of the between-phenotype component of niche width. Also, an expression is derived which partitions niche width into the within-phenotype and between-phenotype components such that the total niche width is simply the sum of measures for these two components. Ecological release is an expansion in niche width by a population which originated in a packed fauna and which has newly colonized an open environment. A population may undergo release in either the within-phenotype or between-phenotype components of niche width or both. Because asexual populations attain the optimum population distribution of phenotypes more rapidly than do sexual populations, asexual ones have a greater potency for release in the between-phenotype component. This claim seems an important explanation for the colonizing ability of asexual species. The process of faunal buildup on an island is a race between a widening of the offspring phenotype distribution of the first species there and dispersion to the island by members of some other ecologically differentiated species. If the widening of the offspring phenotype distribution, and hence the niche width, is slow enough, vacant regions exist on the resource axis which facilitate establishment of emigrants from elsewhere. In plants, an alternative to achieving ecological release by widening the offspring phenotype distribution is to develop self-compatibility.},

This genome-wide genetic interaction network also identified novel components (DIA2, NPT1, HST3, HST4, and the CSM1 module) that potentially contribute to mitotic DNA replication and genomic stability and revealed novel functions of well-studied genes (the CTF18 module) in DRC signaling. This network will guide more detailed characterization of mechanisms governing DNA integrity in yeast and other organisms.},

title = {Quasi-species theory for Horizontal Gene Transfer and Recombination},
abstract = { We introduce a generalization of the parallel, or Crow-Kimura, and Eigen models of molecular evolution to represent the exchange of genetic information between individuals in a population. We study the effect of different schemes of genetic recombination on the steady-state mean fitness and distribution of individuals in the population, through an analytic field theoretic mapping. We investigate both horizontal gene transfer from a population and recombination between pairs of individuals. Somewhat surprisingly, these nonlinear generalizations of quasi-species theory to modern biology are analytically solvable. For two-parent recombination, we find two selected phases, one of which is spectrally rigid. We present exact analytical formulas for the equilibrium mean fitness of the population, in terms of a maximum principle, which are generally applicable to any permutation invariant replication rate function. For smooth fitness landscapes, we show that when positive epistatic interactions are present, recombination or horizontal gene transfer introduces a mild load against selection. Conversely, if the fitness landscape exhibits negative epistasis, horizontal gene transfer or recombination introduce an advantage by enhancing selection towards the fittest genotypes. These results prove that the mutational deterministic hypothesis holds for quasi-species models. For the discontinuous single sharp peak fitness landscape, we show that horizontal gene transfer has no effect on the fitness, while recombination decreases the fitness, for both the parallel and the Eigen models. We present numerical and analytical results as well as phase diagrams for the different cases. },

title = {The Evolutionary Dynamics of Complex Polymorphisms},
abstract = {The joint effects of linkage and epistasis (interaction between non-allelic genes in determining fitness) have been examined for two-locus polymorphisms. The general results are of the following nature: (1) Gene frequencies change toward a stable equilibrium condition which corresponds to a local maximum in mean adaptive value. This change occurs in such a way that the rate of increase of mean adaptive value is not maximum. That is, the trajectory of gene frequency changes is not the "steepest path" on the adaptive surface. (2) In the absence of epistasis, linkage does not affect the final equilibrium of the population. (3) When epistasis is present, linkage must be fairly tight in order for there to be any effect on the final equilibrium. The amount of recombination allowed for such cases is, in general, a function of epistatic deviations. (4) If linkage is tighter than the value demanded by the magnitude of epistatic deviations, there may be permanent linkage disequilibrium of considerable magnitude, and the gene frequencies may also be affected. (5) There are some cases where a stable equilibrium is possible only with a tight linkage. Without such linkage complication, there will be no intermediate gene frequency stable equilibrium. (6) The approach to the equilibrium condition is affected by linkage irrespective of whether there is epistasis although the effect is greater when epistasis is present.},

abstract = {The diversity of virus populations within single infected hosts presents a major difficulty for the natural immune response as well as for vaccine design and antiviral drug therapy. Recently developed pyrophosphate-based sequencing technologies (pyrosequencing) can be used for quantifying this diversity by ultra-deep sequencing of virus samples. We present computational methods for the analysis of such sequence data and apply these techniques to pyrosequencing data obtained from HIV populations within patients harboring drug-resistant virus strains. Our main result is the estimation of the population structure of the sample from the pyrosequencing reads. This inference is based on a statistical approach to error correction, followed by a combinatorial algorithm for constructing a minimal set of haplotypes that explain the data. Using this set of explaining haplotypes, we apply a statistical model to infer the frequencies of the haplotypes in the population via an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We demonstrate that pyrosequencing reads allow for effective population reconstruction by extensive simulations and by comparison to 165 sequences obtained directly from clonal sequencing of four independent, diverse HIV populations. Thus, pyrosequencing can be used for cost-effective estimation of the structure of virus populations, promising new insights into viral evolutionary dynamics and disease control strategies.},

title = {Quantitative trait loci and gene interaction: the quantitative genetics of metapopulations},
abstract = {Genetic population differentiation is typically viewed as differentiation of population means. However, several theories of evolution and speciation postulate that populations differentiate not only with respect to the population means, but also with respect to the effects of alleles within these populations. I develop herein a measure of population differentiation for the 'local average effects' of alleles, where local average effect is defined as the average effect of an allele in a deme measured as a deviation from the metapopulation mean. The differentiation for local average effects has two components, a component attributable to the population mean and a residual component that is attributable to changes in the local average effects independent of the population mean. The variance in local average effects attributable to the population mean is measured as the variance in the mean local average effect of all alleles. The variance in the residual local average effects is measured as the difference between the variance local average effects of individual alleles and the variance in the mean local average effects of all alleles. Differentiation for population means and differentiation for residual local average effects need not be related. I show that when there is only additive gene action, populations can differentiate for population means, but not for residual local average effects. However, if there is gene interaction then populations can also differentiate for local average effects of alleles. The consequence of this differentiation is that the local average effects of alleles change relative to each other such that an allele that is favoured by selection in one population may be removed by selection in other populations. I discuss the evolutionary consequences of differentiation for local average effects, and the interpretation of QTL data in light of this model.},

Single mutations are assumed to be deleterious but harmless (neutral) in appropriate combinations. In proceeding under mutation pressure, natural selection and genetic drift from one fitness peak to another one, a population must therefore pass through a valley of intermediate deleterious states of individual fitness. The expected time for this transition is calculated using diffusion theory. The rate of compensatory evolution, kappa c, is then defined as the inverse of the expected transition time. When selection against deleterious single mutations is strong, kappa c becomes independent on the recombination fraction r between the two loci. Recombination generally reduces the rate of compensatory evolution because it breaks up favorable combinations of double mutants. For complete linkage, kappa c is given by the rate at which favorable combinations of double mutants are produced by compensatory mutation. For r > O, kappa c decreases exponentially with r. In contrast, kappa c becomes independent of r for weak selection. We discuss the dynamics of evolutionary substitutions of compensatory mutants in relation of WRIGHT's shifting balance theory of evolution and use our results to analyze the substitution process in helices of mRNA secondary structures.},

title = {Mobility promotes and jeopardizes biodiversity in rock-paper-scissors games},
abstract = {Biodiversity is essential to the viability of ecological systems. Species diversity in ecosystems is promoted by cyclic, non-hierarchical interactions among competing populations. Central features of such non-transitive relations are represented by the 'rock-paper-scissors' game, in which rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper wraps rock. In combination with spatial dispersal of static populations, this type of competition results in the stable coexistence of all species and the long-term maintenance of biodiversity. However, population mobility is a central feature of real ecosystems: animals migrate, bacteria run and tumble. Here, we observe a critical influence of mobility on species diversity. When mobility exceeds a certain value, biodiversity is jeopardized and lost. In contrast, below this critical threshold all subpopulations coexist and an entanglement of travelling spiral waves forms in the course of time. We establish that this phenomenon is robust; it does not depend on the details of cyclic competition or spatial environment. These findings have important implications for maintenance and temporal development of ecological systems and are relevant for the formation and propagation of patterns in microbial populations or excitable media.},

This approach has practical implications for understanding the impact of host immunity on pathogen evolution and for defining relevant variants for inclusion in vaccine antigens.},

Certain forms of histone methylation cause local formation of heterochromatin, which is readily reversible, whereas DNA methylation leads to stable long-term repression. It has recently become apparent that DNA methylation and histone modification pathways can be dependent on one another, and that this crosstalk can be mediated by biochemical interactions between SET domain histone methyltransferases and DNA methyltransferases. Relationships between DNA methylation and histone modification have implications for understanding normal development as well as somatic cell reprogramming and tumorigenesis.},

Another purpose is to study the powers of existing and newly developed tests and to examine the detailed pattern of polymorphisms under population growth, genetic hitchhiking and background selection. It is found that the polymorphic patterns in a DNA sample under logistic population growth and genetic hitchhiking are very similar and that one of the newly developed tests, Fs, is considerably more powerful than existing tests for rejecting the hypothesis of neutrality of mutations. Background selection gives rise to quite different polymorphic patterns than does logistic population growth or genetic hitchhiking, although all of them show excesses of rare alleles or young mutations. We show that Fu and Li's tests are among the most powerful tests against background selection. Implications of these results are discussed.},

We developed GOLPH (GenOmic Linkage to PHenotype), a statistical method to identify genetic interactions, and used it to characterize the landscape of genetic interactions between gene expression quantitative trait loci. Our results reveal that allele-specific interactions, in which a gene only exerts an influence on the phenotype in the presence of a particular allele at the primary locus, are widespread and that genetic interactions are predominantly nonadditive. The data portray a complex picture in which interacting loci influence the expression of modules of coexpressed genes involved in coherent biological processes and pathways. We show that genetic variation at a single gene can have a major impact on the global transcriptional response, altering interactions between genes through shutdown or activation of pathways. Thus, different cellular states occur not only in response to the external environment but also result from intrinsic genetic variation.},

Cooperative folding into a stable tertiary structure is one aspect of fitness, but evolutionary selection ultimately operates on function, not on structure. In the accompanying paper, we proposed a model for the evolutionary constraint on a small protein interaction module (the WW domain) through application of the SCA, a statistical analysis of multiple sequence alignments. Construction of artificial protein sequences directed only by the SCA showed that the information extracted by this analysis is sufficient to engineer the WW fold at atomic resolution. Here, we demonstrate that these artificial WW sequences function like their natural counterparts, showing class-specific recognition of proline-containing target peptides. Consistent with SCA predictions, a distributed network of residues mediates functional specificity in WW domains. The ability to recapitulate natural-like function in designed sequences shows that a relatively small quantity of sequence information is sufficient to specify the global energetics of amino acid interactions.},

The rate of substitution is shown to be a concave function of the strength of selection as measured by alpha = 2N sigma, where N is the population size and sigma is the standard deviation of fitness. For alpha < 1, the house-of-cards model is essentially a neutral model; for alpha > 4, the model ceases to evolve. The stagnation for large alpha may be understood by appealing to the theory of records. The house-of-cards model evolves to a state where the vast majority of all mutations are deleterious, but precisely one-half of those mutations that fix are deleterious (the other half are advantageous). Thus, the model is not a model of exclusively deleterious evolution as is frequently claimed. It is argued that there are no biologically reasonable models of molecular evolution where the vast majority of all substitutions are deleterious. Other models examined include the exponential and gamma shift models, the Hartl-Dykhuizen-Dean (HDD) model, and the optimum model. Of all those examined, only the optimum and HDD models appear to be reasonable candidates for silent evolution. None of the models are viewed as good candidates for protein evolution, as none are both biologically reasonable and exhibit the variability in substitutions commonly observed in protein sequence data.},

title = {The interscutularis muscle connectome},
abstract = {The complete connectional map (connectome) of a neural circuit is essential for understanding its structure and function. Such maps have only been obtained in Caenorhabditis elegans. As an attempt at solving mammalian circuits, we reconstructed the connectomes of six interscutularis muscles from adult transgenic mice expressing fluorescent proteins in all motor axons. The reconstruction revealed several organizational principles of the neuromuscular circuit. First, the connectomes demonstrate the anatomical basis of the graded tensions in the size principle. Second, they reveal a robust quantitative relationship between axonal caliber, length, and synapse number. Third, they permit a direct comparison of the same neuron on the left and right sides of the same vertebrate animal, and reveal significant structural variations among such neurons, which contrast with the stereotypy of identified neurons in invertebrates. Finally, the wiring length of axons is often longer than necessary, contrary to the widely held view that neural wiring length should be minimized. These results show that mammalian muscle function is implemented with a variety of wiring diagrams that share certain global features but differ substantially in anatomical form. This variability may arise from the dominant role of synaptic competition in establishing the final circuit.},

On a sequential computer, it has been shown that both the RFFT and the FHT algorithms are faster than the FFT algorithm. However, it is not obvious that the same is true on a parallel machine. The communication requirements of the RFFT and the FHT algorithms, which are critical to the cost of any parallel implementation, are different from those of the FFT algorithm. In this paper we present efficient implementations of the RFFT and the FHT algorithms on a hypercube machine. Experimental results are given for the implementation of the RFFT and the FHT algorithms on the NCUBE machine. ER  -},

We find that the dynamics of the population is governed by correlation functions that although being formally down by powers ofN (the population size), nonetheless control the evolution process after a very short transient. The long-time behavior can be found analytically since only one of these higher order correlators (the two-point function) is relevant. We compare and contrast the exact findings derived herein with a previously proposed phenomenological treatment employing mean-field theory supplemented with a cutoff at small population density. Finally, we relate our results to the recently studied case of mutation on a totally flat landscape. ER  -},

abstract = {Earlier, using the semi-deterministic solitary wave approach, we have investigated accumulation of pre-existing beneficial alleles in genomes consisting of a large number of simultaneously evolving sites in the presence of selection and infrequent recombination with small rate r per genome. Our previous results for the dynamics of the fitness distribution of genomes are now interpreted in terms of the life cycle of recombinant clones. We show that, at sufficiently small r, the clones dominating fitness classes, at the moment of their birth, are nearly the best fit in a population. New progeny clones are mostly generated by parental genomes whose fitness falls within a narrow interval in the middle of the high-fitness tail of fitness distribution. We also derive the fitness distribution for the distant ancestors of sites of a randomly sampled genome and show that its form is controlled by a single composite model parameter proportional to r. The ancestral fitness distribution differs dramatically from the fitness distribution of the entire ancient population: it is much broader and localized in the high-fitness tail of the ancient population. We generalize these results to the case of moderately small r to conclude that, regardless of fitness of an individual, all its distant ancestors are exceptionally well fit.},

title = {Identifying clusters of functionally related genes in genomes},
abstract = {MOTIVATION: An increasing body of literature shows that genomes of eukaryotes can contain clusters of functionally related genes. Most approaches to identify gene clusters utilize microarray data or metabolic pathway databases to find groups of genes on chromosomes that are linked by common attributes. A generalized method that can find gene clusters regardless of the mechanism of origin would provide researchers with an unbiased method for finding clusters and studying the evolutionary forces that give rise to them. RESULTS: We present an algorithm to identify gene clusters in eukaryotic genomes that utilizes functional categories defined in graph-based vocabularies such as the Gene Ontology (GO). Clusters identified in this manner need only have a common function and are not constrained by gene expression or other properties. We tested the algorithm by analyzing genomes of a representative set of species. We identified species-specific variation in percentage of clustered genes as well as in properties of gene clusters including size distribution and functional annotation. These properties may be diagnostic of the evolutionary forces that lead to the formation of gene clusters.

abstract = {The Saccharomyces sensu stricto complex consists of six closely related species and one natural hybrid. Intra- and inter- species variability in repetitive elements can help elucidate the population structure and evolution of these close relatives. The chromosome positions of several telomeric associated sequences (TASs) and LTR-retrotransposons have been determined, using PFGE, in 112 isolates. Most of the repetitive elements studied are found in multiple copies in each strain, although in some subpopulations these elements are present in low copy number or are absent. Hybridization patterns and copy numbers of the repetitive elements correlate with geographic distribution. These patterns may yield interesting clues as to the origins and evolution of some TASs and retrotransposons, e.g. we can infer that Y' originated on the left end of chromosome XIV. There is strong evidence for horizontal transfer of Ty2 between S. cerevisiae and S. mikatae. Ty1 and Ty5 are either lost easily or frequently horizontally transferred. We have also found some gross chromosomal rearrangements in isolates within species and a few new natural hybrids between species, indicating that these processes occur in the wild and are not limited to conditions of human influence.

We propose, however, that host obligate asexuality can be favoured in the long term, despite the effects of parasites, under the following conditions. First, the host population structure should approximate a metapopulation. Second, the hosts or the parasites should exhibit relatively high levels of dispersal. Third, parasites must disperse independently of their hosts. In support of this view, we present a computer simulation of host-parasite coevolution in a metapopulation. The simulation demonstrates that a large difference between host and parasite dispersal rates favours an obligately asexual host reproductive strategy over an obligately sexual one. This hypothesis may explain the persistence of anciently asexual taxa, such as the bdelloid rotifers, and the patterns of dispersal seen in obligately asexual groups in general.},

title = {Localisation of Nramp1 in macrophages: modulation with activation and infection},
abstract = {The murine natural resistance-associated macrophage protein, Nramp1, has multiple pleiotropic effects on macrophage activation and regulates survival of intracellular pathogens including Leishmania, Salmonella and Mycobacterium species. Nramp1 acts as an iron transporter, but precisely how this relates to macrophage activation and/or pathogen survival remains unclear. To gain insight into function, anti-Nramp1 monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies are used here to localise Nramp1 following activation and infection. Confocal microscope analysis in uninfected macrophages demonstrates that both the mutant (infection-susceptible) and wild-type (infection-resistant) forms of the protein localise to the membranes of intracellular vesicular compartments. Gold labelling and electron microscopy defines these compartments more precisely as electron-lucent late endosomal and electron-dense lysosomal compartments, with Nramp1 colocalizing with Lamp1 and cathepsins D and L in both compartments, with macrosialin in late endosomes, and with BSA-5 nm gold in pre-loaded lysosomes. Nramp1 is upregulated with interferon-(gamma) and lipopolysaccaride treatment, coinciding with an increase in labelling in lysosomes relative to late endosomes and apparent dispersion of Nramp1-positive vesicles from a perinuclear location towards the periphery of the cytoplasm along the microtubular network. In both control and activated macrophages, expression of the protein is 3- to 4-fold higher in wild-type compared to mutant macrophages. In Leishmania major-infected macrophages, Nramp1 is observed in the membrane of the pathogen-containing phagosomes, which retain a perinuclear localization in resting macrophages. In Mycobacterium avium-infected resting and activated macrophages, Nramp1-positive vesicles migrated to converge, but not always fuse, with pathogen-containing phagosomes. The Nramp1 protein is thus located where it can have a direct influence on phagosome fusion and the microenvironment of the pathogen, as well as in the more general regulation of endosomal/lysosomal function in macrophages.},

title = {Optimal recombination rate in fluctuating environments},
abstract = {The optimal recombination rate which maximizes the long-term geometric average of the population fitness is studied for a two-locus haploid model, assuming that the fitnesses of genotypes AB, Ab, aB and ab are 1 + s(t), 1 - s(t), 1 - s(t), and 1 + s(t), respectively, where s(t) follows various stationary stochastic processes with the average zero. With positive recombination, the polymorphism is stably maintained at both loci. After an initial transient phase, the dynamics are reduced to one dimension, and are analyzed for weak selection limit, strong selection limit, and selection with two state Markovian jump. Results are: (1) If the environmental fluctuation has a predominant periodic component, ropt is approximately inversely proportional to the period irrespective of selection intensity. (2) If the fluctuation is a superposition of many periodic components, the one with the longest period is the most effective in determining ropt because the genetic dynamics cannot track very quick fluctuations (low pass filter effect). (3) If the power spectrum density is decreasing with the frequency, as in pink, or 1/f noises, ropt is small when selection is weak, and increases with the selection intensity. Numerical calculation of the genetic dynamics of a recombination modifier supports all these predictions for the evolutionarily stable recombination rate.},

We hypothesize that highly thermostable proteins and viral proteins represent two opposing adaptation strategies. Thermostable proteins are highly compact and possess well-packed hydrophobic cores and intensely charged surfaces. By contrast, viral proteins, and RNA viral proteins in particular, display a high occurrence of disordered segments and loosely packed cores. These features might endow viral proteins with increased structural flexibility and effective ways to interact with the components of the host. They could also be related to high adaptability levels and mutation rates observed in viruses, thus, representing a unique strategy for buffering the deleterious effects of mutations, such that those that have little (interactions), have little to lose.},

abstract = {We investigate the effect of deleterious mutations on the process of fixation of new advantageous mutants in an asexual population. In particular we wish to study the dependence of the process on the strength of the deleterious mutations. We suppose the existence of epistatic interaction between the genes. We study the model by means of branching process theory and also by numerical simulations. Our results show the occurrence of two distinct regimes of behavior for the probability of fixation of these variants. The occurrence of either regime depends on the ratio between the selective advantage of the beneficial mutation sb and on the selective parameter for deleterious mutations sd. In the former, which takes place for sb/sd< or =1, the probability of fixation increases with the epistasis parameter , whereas for sb/sd>>1 the probability of fixation is a complex function of and the mutation rate U. Surprisingly, we find that for the multiplicative landscape (alpha=1) the probability of fixation Pfix is given by Pfix= pib)e-U/sd where pi(sb) is the probability of fixation for the two-allele model in the absence of mutations as calculated by Haldane (1927, Proc.

abstract = {The Enhancer of split complex [E(spl)-C] in Drosophila encompasses a variety of functional elements controlling bristle patterning and on the basis of prior work is a strong candidate for harboring alleles having subtle effects on bristle number variation. Here we extend earlier studies identifying associations between complex phenotypes and polymorphisms segregating among inbred laboratory lines of Drosophila and test the influence of E(spl)-C on bristle number variation in a natural cohort. We describe results from an association mapping study using 203 polymorphisms spread throughout the E(spl)-C genotyped in 2000 wild-caught Drosophila melanogaster. Despite power to detect associations accounting for as little as 2% of segregating variation for bristle number, and saturating the region with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we identified no single SNP marker showing a significant (additive over loci) effect after correcting for multiple tests. Using a newly developed test we conservatively identify six regions of the E(spl)-C in which the insertion of transposable elements as a class contributes to variation in bristle number, apparently in a sex- or trait-limited fashion. Finally, we carry out all possible 20,503 two-way tests for epistasis and identify a slight excess of marginally significant interactions, although none survive multiple-testing correction. It may not be straightforward to extend the results of laboratory-based association studies to natural populations.},

title = {A ruby in the rubbish: beneficial mutations, deleterious mutations and the evolution of sex},
abstract = {This study presents a mathematical model in which a single beneficial mutation arises in a very large population that is subject to frequent deleterious mutations. The results suggest that, if the population is sexual, then the deleterious mutations will have little effect on the ultimate fate of the beneficial mutation. However, if most offspring are produced asexually, then the probability that the beneficial mutation will be lost from the population may be greatly enhanced by the deleterious mutations. Thus, sexual populations may adapt much more quickly than populations where most reproduction is asexual. Some of the results were produced using computer simulation methods, and a technique was developed that allows treatment of arbitrarily large numbers of individuals in a reasonable amount of computer time. This technique may be of prove useful for the analysis of a wide variety of models, though there are some constraints on its applicability. For example, the technique requires that reproduction can be described by Poisson processes.},

The resulting genetic network is biased toward interactions between functionally related genes, enabling identification of a previously uncharacterized essential gene (PGA1) required for specific functions of the endoplasmic reticulum. But there are also many interactions between genes with dissimilar functions, suggesting that individual essential genes are required for buffering many cellular processes.

title = {Extensive recombination among human immunodeficiency virus type 1 quasispecies makes an important contribution to viral diversity in individual patients},
abstract = {Although recombination during human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication in vitro and in vivo has been documented, little information is available concerning the extent that recombination contributes to the diversity of HIV-1 quasispecies in the course of infection in individual patents. To investigate the impact of recombination on viral diversity, we developed a technique that permits the isolation of contemporaneous clonal viral populations resulting from single infectious events by plasma-derived viruses, thereby permitting the assessment of recombination throughout the viral genomes, including widely separated loci, from individual patients. A comparison of the genomic sequences of clonal viruses from six patients, including patients failing treatment with antiretroviral therapy, demonstrated strong evidence for extensive recombination. Recombination increased viral diversity through two distinct mechanisms. First, evolutionary bottlenecks appeared to be restricted to minimal segments of the genome required to obtain selective advantage, thereby preserving diversity in adjacent regions. Second, recombination between adjacent gene segments appeared to generate diversity in both pol and env genes. Thus, the shuffling of resistance mutations within the genes coding for the protease and reverse transcriptase, as well as recombination between these regions, could increase the diversity of drug resistance genotypes. These findings demonstrate that recombination in HIV-1 contributes to the diversity of viral quasispecies by restricting evolutionary bottlenecks to gene segments and by generating novel genotypes in pol and env, supporting the idea that recombination may be critical to adaptive evolution of HIV in the face of constantly moving selective pressures, whether exerted by the immune system or antiretroviral therapy.},

title = {Genome evolution in yeasts},
abstract = {Identifying the mechanisms of eukaryotic genome evolution by comparative genomics is often complicated by the multiplicity of events that have taken place throughout the history of individual lineages, leaving only distorted and superimposed traces in the genome of each living organism. The hemiascomycete yeasts, with their compact genomes, similar lifestyle and distinct sexual and physiological properties, provide a unique opportunity to explore such mechanisms. We present here the complete, assembled genome sequences of four yeast species, selected to represent a broad evolutionary range within a single eukaryotic phylum, that after analysis proved to be molecularly as diverse as the entire phylum of chordates. A total of approximately 24,200 novel genes were identified, the translation products of which were classified together with Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins into about 4,700 families, forming the basis for interspecific comparisons. Analysis of chromosome maps and genome redundancies reveal that the different yeast lineages have evolved through a marked interplay between several distinct molecular mechanisms, including tandem gene repeat formation, segmental duplication, a massive genome duplication and extensive gene loss.},

abstract = {High level resistance to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT, zidovudine or Retrovir) is conferred by the presence of four or five mutations (Met-41-->Leu; Asp-67-->Asn; Lys-70-->Arg; Thr-215-->Tyr or Phe; Lys-219-->Gln) in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase. The order of appearance of these five mutations in asymptomatic patients during therapy has been studied. This has enabled us to propose a model for the acquisition of zidovudine resistance mutations during the treatment of high-risk asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals. A consistent acquisition pattern of mutations at codons 41, 70 and 215 was observed in 17 individuals. Complex mixtures of HIV species containing different combinations of single and linked double resistance mutations were present early in zidovudine therapy in isolates from two patients studied in detail. From these mixtures the linked Leu-41/Tyr-215 genotype outgrew all others initially. The development of each new virus population is likely to be mediated primarily by the increase in the level of drug resistance rather than changes in the growth kinetics of the virus. This leads us to conclude that one major driving force in the outgrowth of different mutant viruses is the selective advantage conferred by higher levels of drug resistance.},

title = {Towards an Understanding of the Migration of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus},
abstract = {Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is a lethal disease caused by CCHF Virus (CCHFV). It is one of the most widespread medically significant tick-borne pathogen, with a distribution that coincides well with the geographic occurrence of its tick vector, Hyalomma marginatum marginatum. Sporadic outbreaks of CCHF have previously been recognized in Asia, Africa, Middle East and Europe but in the 21st century, outbreaks have become more frequent in former Yugoslavia, Turkey and Iran. It has been suggested that CCHFV is a migrating pathogen but it is not clear to what extent. We have for the first time, analyzed the worldwide migration pattern of CCHFV. Our results showed that Turkey may be a donor in Europe, both towards east and west, while the United Arab Emirates acted as a donor in the Middle East and China was found to be the origin for genotype 2. Finally, we showed that migration of CCHFV was unrestricted between Iran and Pakistan. Considering the distribution and coincidence of the tick vector with CCHFV and CCHF, and the fact that the viral tick vector is present in Western Europe, future outbreaks may extend to include hitherto naive areas, suggesting that increased surveillance and geographic mapping of this lethal pathogen is needed.},

title = {Sympatric speciation by sexual selection},
abstract = {There is increasing evidence for the process of sympatric speciation, in which reproductive isolation of species occurs without physical isolation. Theoretical models have focused on disruptive natural selection as the crucial pressure for splitting a species. Here we report the theoretical finding that sympatric speciation may be caused by sexual selection even without disruptive natural selection. Specifically, we show that variation in a male secondary sexual character with two conspicuous extremes and the corresponding variance in female mating preference around no preference may jointly evolve into bimodal distributions with increasing modal divergence of the male and female traits, pulling a population apart into two prezygotically isolated populations. This mode of speciation, driven by two runaway processes in different directions, is promoted by an increase in the efficiency of females in discriminating among males or a decrease in the cost of male conspicuousness, indicating that sympatric speciation may occur more readily if barrier-free or predator-free conditions arise. Although even a slight cost of female preference would cancel the runaway process of sexual selection, it would not cancel the divergent runaway processes of sympatric speciation.},

title = {Inaugural Article: The universal distribution of evolutionary rates of genes and distinct characteristics of eukaryotic genes of different apparent ages},
abstract = {The evolutionary rates of protein-coding genes in an organism span, approximately, 3 orders of magnitude and show a universal, approximately log-normal distribution in a broad variety of species from prokaryotes to mammals. This universal distribution implies a steady-state process, with identical distributions of evolutionary rates among genes that are gained and genes that are lost. A mathematical model of such process is developed under the single assumption of the constancy of the distributions of the propensities for gene loss (PGL). This model predicts that genes of different ages, that is, genes with homologs detectable at different phylogenetic depths, substantially differ in those variables that correlate with PGL. We computationally partition protein-coding genes from humans, flies, and Aspergillus fungus into age classes, and show that genes of different ages retain the universal log-normal distribution of evolutionary rates, with a shift toward higher rates in "younger" classes but also with a substantial overlap. The only exception involves human primate-specific genes that show a heavy tail of rapidly evolving genes, probably owing to gene annotation artifacts. As predicted, the gene age classes differ in characteristics correlated with PGL. Compared with "young" genes (e.g., mammal-specific human ones), "old" genes (e.g., eukaryote-specific), on average, are longer, are expressed at a higher level, possess a higher intron density, evolve slower on the short time scale, and are subject to stronger purifying selection. Thus, genome evolution fits a simple model with approximately uniform rates of gene gain and loss, without major bursts of genomic innovation.},

title = {Clonal interference in large populations},
abstract = {Clonal interference, the competition between lineages arising from different beneficial mutations in an asexually reproducing population, is an important factor determining the tempo and mode of microbial adaptation. The standard theory of this phenomenon neglects the occurrence of multiple mutations as well as the correlation between loss by genetic drift and clonal competition, which is questionable in large populations. Working within the Wright-Fisher model with multiplicative fitness (no epistasis), we determine the rate of adaptation asymptotically for very large population sizes and show that the standard theory fails in this regime. Our study also explains the success of the standard theory in predicting the rate of adaptation for moderately large populations. Furthermore, we show that the nature of the substitution process changes qualitatively when multiple mutations are allowed for, because several mutations can be fixed in a single fixation event. As a consequence, the index of dispersion for counts of the fixation process displays a minimum as a function of population size, whereas the origination process of fixed mutations becomes completely regular for very large populations. We find that the number of mutations fixed in a single event is geometrically distributed as in the neutral case. These conclusions are based on extensive simulations combined with analytic results for the limit of infinite population size.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence in eukaryotic genomes that gene order is not random, even allowing for tandem duplication. Notably, in numerous genomes, genes of similar expression tend to be clustered. Are there other reasons for clustering of functionally similar genes? If genes are linked to enable genetic, rather than physical clustering, then we also expect that clusters of certain genes might be associated with blocks of reduced recombination rates. Here we show that, in yeast, essential genes are highly clustered and this clustering is independent of clustering of co-expressed genes and of tandem duplications. Adjacent pairs of essential genes are preferentially conserved through evolution. Notably, we also find that clusters of essential genes are in regions of low recombination and that larger clusters have lower recombination rates. These results suggest that selection acts to modify both the fine-scale intragenomic variation in the recombination rate and the distribution of genes and provide evidence for co-evolution of gene order and recombination rate.},

Generations are discrete and nonoverlapping; the monoecious population mates at random. The character is determined by arbitrarily many multiallelic loci without epistasis; the linkage map is also arbitrary. The genotypic values of the character are constant.

In that case, C is the genic variance in fitness, and the relative error cannot exceed one half the greatest genotypic selection coefficient.},

Statistical models applied to HIV-1 sequence data can help to elucidate the nature of these selection pressures through comparisons of non-synonymous (or amino acid changing) and synonymous (or amino acid preserving) substitution rates. These models also need to take into account the non-independence of sequences due to their shared evolutionary history. We review how we have developed these methods and have applied them to characterize the evolution of HIV-1 in vivo.

title = {Transposon dynamics and the breeding system},
abstract = {The selfish DNA hypothesis predicts that natural selection is responsible for preventing the unregulated build up of transposable elements in organismal genomes. Accordingly, between-species differences in the strength and effectiveness of selection against transposons should be important in driving the evolution of transposon activity and abundance. We used a modeling approach to investigate how the rate of self-fertilization influences the population dynamics of transposable elements. Contrasting effects of the breeding system were observed under selection based on transposon disruption of gene function versus selection based on element-mediated ectopic exchange. This suggests that the comparison of TE copy number in organisms with different breeding systems may provide a test of the relative importance of these forces in regulating transposon multiplication. The effects of breeding system also interacted with population size, particularly when there was no element excision. The strength and effectiveness of selection against transposons was reflected not only in their equilibrium abundance, but also in the per-site element frequency of individual insertions and the coefficient of variation in copy number. These results are discussed in relation to evidence on transposon abundance available from the literature, and suggestions for future data collection.},

abstract = {Clonal diversifications of HIV virus were monitored by periodic samplings on each of the six patients with regard to 183- to 335-bp segments of the env gene, which invariably included the functionally critical V3 region. Subsequently, six individual phylogenetic trees of viral variants were constructed. It was found that at one time or another during the course of disease progression, viral variants were inexplicably released from a strong negative selection against nonsynonymous base substitutions, possibly indicating positive selection. This resulted in concentrated amino acid substitutions at five specific sites within the V3 region. It was noted that these sites were often involved as antigenic determinants that provoked the host immune response and that these sites were also involved in the determination of viral phenotypes as to their cell tropism, syncytium formation capability, and replication rates.},

Recently, it has been observed experimentally that by pulling proteins in different directions relative to their secondary structure, one can gain a better understanding of the shape of the energy landscape. We consider simple lattice models which are anisotropic in nature to study the response of a force in unfolding of a polymer. Our analytical solution of the model, supported by extensive numerical calculations, reveal that the force temperature diagrams are very different depending on the direction of the applied force. We find that either unzipping or shearing kind transitions dominate the dynamics of the unfolding process depending solely on the direction of the applied force.},

title = {Beneficial mutation selection balance and the effect of linkage on positive selection},
abstract = {When beneficial mutations are rare, they accumulate by a series of selective sweeps. But when they are common, many beneficial mutations will occur before any can fix, so there will be many different mutant lineages in the population concurrently. In an asexual population, these different mutant lineages interfere and not all can fix simultaneously. In addition, further beneficial mutations can accumulate in mutant lineages while these are still a minority of the population. In this article, we analyze the dynamics of such multiple mutations and the interplay between multiple mutations and interference between clones. These result in substantial variation in fitness accumulating within a single asexual population. The amount of variation is determined by a balance between selection, which destroys variation, and beneficial mutations, which create more. The behavior depends in a subtle way on the population parameters: the population size, the beneficial mutation rate, and the distribution of the fitness increments of the potential beneficial mutations. The mutation-selection balance leads to a continually evolving population with a steady-state fitness variation. This variation increases logarithmically with both population size and mutation rate and sets the rate at which the population accumulates beneficial mutations, which thus also grows only logarithmically with population size and mutation rate. These results imply that mutator phenotypes are less effective in larger asexual populations. They also have consequences for the advantages (or disadvantages) of sex via the Fisher-Muller effect; these are discussed briefly.},

abstract = {We investigate the evolution of viral strategies to counteract immunological attack. These strategies can be divided into two classes: those that impair the immune response inside or at the surface of a virus-infected cell and those that impair the immune response outside an infected cell. The former strategies confer a "selfish" individual selective advantage for intra-host competition among viruses. The latter strategies confer an "unselfish" selective advantage to the virus population as a group. A mutant, defective in the gene coding for the extracellular immune function-impairment strategy, may be protected from immune attack because the wild-type virus in the same host successfully impairs the host's immune function. Such "unselfish" defense strategies are neutral with respect to intra-host competition. We present simple models of viral intra-host and combined inter- and intra-host evolution. We show that selfish strategies can evolve by intra-host evolution. Unselfish strategies may evolve if inter-host selection pressures outweigh intra-host selection, suggesting that such strategies can only evolve in viruses with low mutation rates.},

abstract = {The sterility and inviability of species hybrids can be explained by between-locus "Dobzhansky-Muller" incompatibilities: alleles that are fit on their "normal" genetic backgrounds sometimes lower fitness when brought together in hybrids. We present a model of two-locus incompatibilities that distinguishes among three types of hybrid interactions: those between heterozygous loci (H(0)), those between a heterozygous and a homozygous (or hemizygous) locus (H(1)), and those between homozygous loci (H(2)). We predict the relative fitnesses of hybrid genotypes by calculating the expected numbers of each type of incompatibility. We use this model to study Haldane's rule and the large effect of X chromosomes on postzygotic isolation. We show that the severity of H(0) vs. H(1) incompatibilities is key to understanding Haldane's rule, while the severity of H(1) vs. H(2) incompatibilities must also be considered to explain large X effects. Large X effects are not inevitable in backcross analyses but rather-like Haldane's rule-may often reflect the recessivity of alleles causing postzygotic isolation. We also consider incompatibilities involving the Y (or W) chromosome and maternal effects. Such incompatibilities are common in Drosophila species crosses, and their consequences in male- vs. female-heterogametic taxa may explain the pattern of exceptions to Haldane's rule.},

title = {Inferring the joint demographic history of multiple populations from multidimensional SNP frequency data},
abstract = {Demographic models built from genetic data play important roles in illuminating prehistorical events and serving as null models in genome scans for selection. We introduce an inference method based on the joint frequency spectrum of genetic variants within and between populations. For candidate models we numerically compute the expected spectrum using a diffusion approximation to the one-locus, two-allele Wright-Fisher process, involving up to three simultaneous populations. Our approach is a composite likelihood scheme, since linkage between neutral loci alters the variance but not the expectation of the frequency spectrum. We thus use bootstraps incorporating linkage to estimate uncertainties for parameters and significance values for hypothesis tests. Our method can also incorporate selection on single sites, predicting the joint distribution of selected alleles among populations experiencing a bevy of evolutionary forces, including expansions, contractions, migrations, and admixture. We model human expansion out of Africa and the settlement of the New World, using 5 Mb of noncoding DNA resequenced in 68 individuals from 4 populations (YRI, CHB, CEU, and MXL) by the Environmental Genome Project. We infer divergence between West African and Eurasian populations 140 thousand years ago (95% confidence interval: 40-270 kya). This is earlier than other genetic studies, in part because we incorporate migration. We estimate the European (CEU) and East Asian (CHB) divergence time to be 23 kya (95% c.i.: 17-43 kya), long after archeological evidence places modern humans in Europe. Finally, we estimate divergence between East Asians (CHB) and Mexican-Americans (MXL) of 22 kya (95% c.i.: 16.3-26.9 kya), and our analysis yields no evidence for subsequent migration. Furthermore, combining our demographic model with a previously estimated distribution of selective effects among newly arising amino acid mutations accurately predicts the frequency spectrum of nonsynonymous variants across three continental populations (YRI, CHB, CEU).},

title = {Modularity and community structure in networks},
abstract = {Many networks of interest in the sciences, including social networks, computer networks, and metabolic and regulatory networks, are found to divide naturally into communities or modules. The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure is one of the outstanding issues in the study of networked systems. One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as "modularity" over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets.},

title = {Evolution can favor antagonistic epistasis},
abstract = {The accumulation of deleterious mutations plays a major role in evolution, and key to this are the interactions between their fitness effects, known as epistasis. Whether mutations tend to interact synergistically (with multiple mutations being more deleterious than would be expected from their individual fitness effects) or antagonistically is important for a variety of evolutionary questions, particularly the evolution of sex. Unfortunately, the experimental evidence on the prevalence and strength of epistasis is mixed and inconclusive. Here we study theoretically whether synergistic or antagonistic epistasis is likely to be favored by evolution and by how much. We find that in the presence of recombination, evolution favors less synergistic or more antagonistic epistasis whenever mutations that change the epistasis in this direction are possible. This is because evolution favors increased buffering against the effects of deleterious mutations. This suggests that we should not expect synergistic epistasis to be widespread in nature and hence that the mutational deterministic hypothesis for the advantage of sex may not apply widely.},

The method was applied to bark and flux material collected from broad-leaved trees (mostly Quercus spp.) and to associated soils. Many candidate wild strains of Saccharomyces were isolated using this method, most of them from soils associated with oaks. Matings to genetically marked tester strains of S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus identified roughly equal numbers of these two species within this collection. The S. paradoxus isolates showed significant partial reproductive isolation from a conspecific European strain, whereas the S. cerevisiae isolates did not. Variability in both chromosome size and Ty1 element hybridization profiles was observed within both populations at this site. We discuss the relevance of our data to current debates concerning whether S. cerevisiae is a wild species or a domesticated species.},

title = {Optimizing information flow in small genetic networks. I},
abstract = { In order to survive, reproduce and (in multicellular organisms) differentiate, cells must control the concentrations of the myriad different proteins that are encoded in the genome. The precision of this control is limited by the inevitable randomness of individual molecular events. Here we explore how cells can maximize their control power in the presence of these physical limits; formally, we solve the theoretical problem of maximizing the information transferred from inputs to outputs when the number of available molecules is held fixed. We start with the simplest version of the problem, in which a single transcription factor protein controls the readout of one or more genes by binding to DNA. We further simplify by assuming that this regulatory network operates in steady state, that the noise is small relative to the available dynamic range, and that the target genes do not interact. Even in this simple limit, we find a surprisingly rich set of optimal solutions. Importantly, for each locally optimal regulatory network, all parameters are determined once the physical constraints on the number of available molecules are specified. Although we are solving an over-simplified version of the problem facing real cells, we see parallels between the structure of these optimal solutions and the behavior of actual genetic regulatory networks. Subsequent papers will discuss more complete versions of the problem. },

title = {Competition between recombination and epistasis can cause a transition from allele to genotype selection},
abstract = {Biochemical and regulatory interactions central to biological networks are expected to cause extensive genetic interactions or epistasis affecting the heritability of complex traits and the distribution of genotypes in populations. However, the inference of epistasis from the observed phenotype-genotype correlation is impeded by statistical difficulties, while the theoretical understanding of the effects of epistasis remains limited, in turn limiting our ability to interpret data. Of particular interest is the biologically relevant situation of numerous interacting genetic loci with small individual contributions to fitness. Here, we present a computational model of selection dynamics involving many epistatic loci in a recombining population. We demonstrate that a large number of polymorphic interacting loci can, despite frequent recombination, exhibit cooperative behavior that locks alleles into favorable genotypes leading to a population consisting of a set of competing clones. When the recombination rate exceeds a certain critical value that depends on the strength of epistasis, this "genotype selection" regime disappears in an abrupt transition, giving way to "allele selection"-the regime where different loci are only weakly correlated as expected in sexually reproducing populations. We show that large populations attain highest fitness at a recombination rate just below critical. Clustering of interacting sets of genes on a chromosome leads to the emergence of an intermediate regime, where blocks of cooperating alleles lock into genetic modules. These haplotype blocks disappear in a second transition to pure allele selection. Our results demonstrate that the collective effect of many weak epistatic interactions can have dramatic effects on the population structure.},

abstract = {A method is developed that describes the effects on an arbitrary number of autosomal loci of selection on haploid and diploid stages, of nonrandom mating between haploid individuals, and of recombination. We provide exact recursions for the dynamics of allele frequencies and linkage disequilibria (nonrandom associations of alleles across loci). When selection is weak relative to recombination, our recursions provide simple approximations for the linkage disequilibria among arbitrary combinations of loci. We show how previous models of sex-independent natural selection on diploids, assortative mating between haploids, and sexual selection on haploids can be analyzed in this framework. Using our weak-selection approximations, we derive new results concerning the coevolution of male traits and female preferences under natural and sexual selection. In particular, we provide general expressions for the intensity of linkage-disequilibrium induced selection experienced by loci that contribute to female preferences for specific male traits. Our general results support the previous observation that these indirect selection forces are so weak that they are unlikely to dominate the evolution of preference-producing loci.},

title = {Maximal stimulation of meiotic recombination by a yeast transcription factor requires the transcription activation domain and a DNA-binding domain},
abstract = {The DNA sequences located upstream of the yeast HIS4 represent a very strong meiotic recombination hotspot. Although the activity of this hotspot requires the transcription activator Rap1p, the level of HIS4 transcription is not directly related to the level of recombination. We find that the recombination-stimulating activity of Rap1p requires the transcription activation domain of the protein. We show that a hybrid protein with the Gal4p DNA-binding domain and the Rap1p activation domain can stimulate recombination in a strain in which Gal4p-binding sites are inserted upstream of HIS4. In addition, we find recombination hotspot activity associated with the Gal4p DNA-binding sites that is independent of known transcription factors. We suggest that yeast cells have two types of recombination hotspots, alpha (transcription factor dependent) and beta (transcription factor independent).},

We studied 938 unrelated individuals from 51 populations of the Human Genome Diversity Panel at 650,000 common single-nucleotide polymorphism loci. Individual ancestry and population substructure were detectable with very high resolution. The relationship between haplotype heterozygosity and geography was consistent with the hypothesis of a serial founder effect with a single origin in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, we observed a pattern of ancestral allele frequency distributions that reflects variation in population dynamics among geographic regions.

title = {Optimal strategy for competence differentiation in bacteria},
abstract = {A phylogenetically diverse subset of bacterial species are naturally competent for transformation by DNA. Transformation entails recombination of genes between different lineages, representing a form of bacterial sex that increases standing genetic variation. We first assess whether homologous recombination by transformation is favored by evolution. Using stochastic population genetic computer simulations in which beneficial and deleterious mutations occur at many loci throughout the whole genome, we find that transformation can increase both the rate of adaptive evolution and the equilibrium level of fitness. Secondly, motivated by experimental observations of Bacillus subtilis, we assume that competence additionally entails a weak persister phenotype, i.e., the rates of birth and death are reduced for these cells. Consequently, persisters evolve more slowly than non-persisters. We show via simulation that strains which stochastically switch into and out of the competent phenotype are evolutionarily favored over strains that express only a single phenotype. Our model's simplicity enables us to derive and numerically solve a system of finite- deterministic equations that describe the evolutionary dynamics. The observed tradeoff between the benefit of recombination and the cost of persistence may explain the previously mysterious observation that only a fractional subpopulation of B. subtilis cells express competence. More generally, this work demonstrates that population genetic forces can give rise to phenotypic diversity even in an unchanging and homogeneous environment.},

title = {Antibody neutralization and escape by HIV-1},
abstract = {Neutralizing antibodies (Nab) are a principal component of an effective human immune response to many pathogens, yet their role in HIV-1 infection is unclear. To gain a better understanding of this role, we examined plasma from patients with acute HIV infection. Here we report the detection of autologous Nab as early as 52 days after detection of HIV-specific antibodies. The viral inhibitory activity of Nab resulted in complete replacement of neutralization-sensitive virus by successive populations of resistant virus. Escape virus contained mutations in the env gene that were unexpectedly sparse, did not map generally to known neutralization epitopes, and involved primarily changes in N-linked glycosylation. This pattern of escape, and the exceptional density of HIV-1 envelope glycosylation generally, led us to postulate an evolving 'glycan shield' mechanism of neutralization escape whereby selected changes in glycan packing prevent Nab binding but not receptor binding. Direct support for this model was obtained by mutational substitution showing that Nab-selected alterations in glycosylation conferred escape from both autologous antibody and epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies. The evolving glycan shield thus represents a new mechanism contributing to HIV-1 persistence in the face of an evolving antibody repertoire.},

title = {Analysis of epistatic interactions and fitness landscapes using a new geometric approach},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding interactions between mutations and how they affect fitness is a central problem in evolutionary biology that bears on such fundamental issues as the structure of fitness landscapes and the evolution of sex. To date, analyses of fitness landscapes have focused either on the overall directional curvature of the fitness landscape or on the distribution of pairwise interactions. In this paper, we propose and employ a new mathematical approach that allows a more complete description of multi-way interactions and provides new insights into the structure of fitness landscapes. RESULTS: We apply the mathematical theory of gene interactions developed by Beerenwinkel et al. to a fitness landscape for Escherichia coli obtained by Elena and Lenski. The genotypes were constructed by introducing nine mutations into a wild-type strain and constructing a restricted set of 27 double mutants. Despite the absence of mutants higher than second order, our analysis of this genotypic space points to previously unappreciated gene interactions, in addition to the standard pairwise epistasis. Our analysis confirms Elena and Lenski's inference that the fitness landscape is complex, so that an overall measure of curvature obscures a diversity of interaction types. We also demonstrate that some mutations contribute disproportionately to this complexity. In particular, some mutations are systematically better than others at mixing with other mutations. We also find a strong correlation between epistasis and the average fitness loss caused by deleterious mutations. In particular, the epistatic deviations from multiplicative expectations tend toward more positive values in the context of more deleterious mutations, emphasizing that pairwise epistasis is a local property of the fitness landscape. Finally, we determine the geometry of the fitness landscape, which reflects many of these biologically interesting features. CONCLUSION: A full description of complex fitness landscapes requires more information than the average curvature or the distribution of independent pairwise interactions. We have proposed a mathematical approach that, in principle, allows a complete description and, in practice, can suggest new insights into the structure of real fitness landscapes. Our analysis emphasizes the value of non-independent genotypes for these inferences.},

abstract = {Explaining the evolutionary maintenance of sex remains a key problem in evolutionary biology. One potential benefit of sex is that it may allow a more rapid adaptive response when environmental conditions change, by increasing the efficiency with which selection can fix beneficial mutations. Here I show that sex can increase the rate of adaptation in the facultatively sexual single-celled chlorophyte Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, but that the benefits of sex depend crucially on the size of the population that is adapting: sex has a marked effect in large populations but little effect in small populations. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the benefits of sex in a novel environment, including stochastic effects in small populations, clonal interference and epistasis between beneficial alleles. These results indicate that clonal interference is important in this system.},

abstract = {Variation in vein position and wing shape of Drosophila melanogaster depends on many genes. In the following, we report the results of a QTL analysis of wing shape in D. melanogaster. We identified QTL responsible for natural variation for wing shape and analyzed their interactions with developmental genetic signaling pathways important for vein positioning. The QTL analysis indicated that the total number of QTL segregating in this population is likely to be very large. The locations of putative QTL identified in this study were compared to those identified in previous studies and, while there is more correspondence across studies than expected by chance on the third chromosome, the studies appear to have identified different QTL. Using a complementation design, we tested for interactions among these QTL with the Hedgehog and Decapentaplegic signaling pathways, which are important for the development and position of vein pairs L3-L4 and L2-L5. Three QTL showed strong interactions with these two pathways, supporting the hypothesis that these QTL are involved in these pathways. Naturally segregating variation can therefore act through known signaling pathways to produce variation in vein position.},

For large populations, the distribution of haplotype frequencies for two linked loci under the classical Wright-Fisher model is almost impossible to compute because of numerical reasons. However the Wright-Fisher process can in such cases be approximated by a diffusion process and the transition density can then be deduced from the Kolmogorov equations. As no exact solution has been found for these equations, we developed a numerical method based on finite differences to solve them. It applies to transient states and models including selection or mutations. We show by several tests that this method is accurate for computing the conditional joint density of haplotype frequencies given that no haplotype has been lost. We also prove that it is far less time consuming than other methods such as Monte Carlo simulations.},

title = {Identification of sequential viral escape mutants associated with altered T-cell responses in a human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected individual},
abstract = {Control of viremia in natural human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in humans is associated with a virus-specific T-cell response. However, still much is unknown with regard to the extent of CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses required to successfully control HIV-1 infection and to what extent CTL epitope escape can account for rises in viral load and ultimate progression to disease. In this study, we chose to monitor through full-length genome sequence of replication-competent biological clones the modifications that occurred within predicted CTL epitopes and to identify whether the alterations resulted in epitope escape from CTL recognition. From an extensive analysis of 59 biological HIV-1 clones generated over a period of 4 years from a single individual in whom the viral load was observed to rise, we identified the locations in the genome of five CD8(+) CTL epitopes. Fixed mutations were identified within the p17, gp120, gp41, Nef, and reverse transcriptase genes. Using a gamma interferon ELIspot assay, we identified for four of the five epitopes with fixed mutations a complete loss of T-cell reactivity against the wild-type epitope and a partial loss of reactivity against the mutant epitope. These results demonstrate the sequential accumulation of CTL escape in a patient during disease progression, indicating that multiple combinations of T-cell epitopes are required to control viremia.},

title = {The Value of Information for Populations in Varying Environments},
abstract = { The notion of information pervades informal descriptions of biological systems, but formal treatments face the problem of defining a quantitative measure of information rooted in a concept of fitness, which is itself an elusive notion. Here, we present a model of population dynamics where this problem is amenable to a mathematical analysis. In the limit where any information about future environmental variations is common to the members of the population, our model is equivalent to known models of financial investment. In this case, the population can be interpreted as a portfolio of financial assets and previous analyses have shown that a key quantity of Shannon's communication theory, the mutual information, sets a fundamental limit on the value of information. We show that this bound can be violated when accounting for features that are irrelevant in finance but inherent to biological systems, such as the stochasticity present at the individual level. This leads us to generalize the measures of uncertainty and information usually encountered in information theory. },

title = {Quasispecies diversity determines pathogenesis through cooperative interactions in a viral population},
abstract = {An RNA virus population does not consist of a single genotype; rather, it is an ensemble of related sequences, termed quasispecies. Quasispecies arise from rapid genomic evolution powered by the high mutation rate of RNA viral replication. Although a high mutation rate is dangerous for a virus because it results in nonviable individuals, it has been hypothesized that high mutation rates create a 'cloud' of potentially beneficial mutations at the population level, which afford the viral quasispecies a greater probability to evolve and adapt to new environments and challenges during infection. Mathematical models predict that viral quasispecies are not simply a collection of diverse mutants but a group of interactive variants, which together contribute to the characteristics of the population. According to this view, viral populations, rather than individual variants, are the target of evolutionary selection. Here we test this hypothesis by examining the consequences of limiting genomic diversity on viral populations. We find that poliovirus carrying a high-fidelity polymerase replicates at wild-type levels but generates less genomic diversity and is unable to adapt to adverse growth conditions. In infected animals, the reduced viral diversity leads to loss of neurotropism and an attenuated pathogenic phenotype. Notably, using chemical mutagenesis to expand quasispecies diversity of the high-fidelity virus before infection restores neurotropism and pathogenesis. Analysis of viruses isolated from brain provides direct evidence for complementation between members in the quasispecies, indicating that selection indeed occurs at the population level rather than on individual variants. Our study provides direct evidence for a fundamental prediction of the quasispecies theory and establishes a link between mutation rate, population dynamics and pathogenesis.},

title = {Extensive intrasubtype recombination in South African human immunodeficiency virus type 1 subtype C infections},
abstract = {Recombinant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains containing sequences from different viral genetic subtypes (intersubtype) and different lineages from within the same subtype (intrasubtype) have been observed. A consequence of recombination can be the distortion of the phylogenetic signal. Several intersubtype recombinants have been identified; however, less is known about the frequency of intrasubtype recombination. For this study, near-full-length HIV-1 subtype C genomes from 270 individuals were evaluated for the presence of intrasubtype recombination. A sliding window schema (window, 2 kb; step, 385 bp) was used to partition the aligned sequences. The Shimodaira-Hasegawa test detected significant topological incongruence in 99.6% of the comparisons of the maximum-likelihood trees generated from each sequence partition, a result that could be explained by recombination. Using RECOMBINE, we detected significant levels of recombination using five random subsets of the sequences. With a set of 23 topologically consistent sequences used as references, bootscanning followed by the interactive informative site test defined recombination breakpoints. Using two multiple-comparison correction methods, 47% of the sequences showed significant evidence of recombination in both analyses. Estimated evolutionary rates were revised from 0.51%/year (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.53%) with all sequences to 0.46%/year (95% CI, 0.38 to 0.48%) with the putative recombinants removed. The timing of the subtype C epidemic origin was revised from 1961 (95% CI, 1947 to 1962) with all sequences to 1958 (95% CI, 1949 to 1960) with the putative recombinants removed. Thus, intrasubtype recombinants are common within the subtype C epidemic and these impact analyses of HIV-1 evolution.},

abstract = {Genomic surveys in humans identify a large amount of recent positive selection. Using the 3.9-million HapMap SNP dataset, we found that selection has accelerated greatly during the last 40,000 years. We tested the null hypothesis that the observed age distribution of recent positively selected linkage blocks is consistent with a constant rate of adaptive substitution during human evolution. We show that a constant rate high enough to explain the number of recently selected variants would predict (i) site heterozygosity at least 10-fold lower than is observed in humans, (ii) a strong relationship of heterozygosity and local recombination rate, which is not observed in humans, (iii) an implausibly high number of adaptive substitutions between humans and chimpanzees, and (iv) nearly 100 times the observed number of high-frequency linkage disequilibrium blocks. Larger populations generate more new selected mutations, and we show the consistency of the observed data with the historical pattern of human population growth. We consider human demographic growth to be linked with past changes in human cultures and ecologies. Both processes have contributed to the extraordinarily rapid recent genetic evolution of our species.},

Surprisingly, though, population genetic theory allows us to predict what this distribution should look like under fairly general assumptions. Using extreme value theory, I derive this distribution and show that it has two unexpected properties. First, the distribution of beneficial fitness effects at a gene is exponential. Second, the distribution of beneficial effects at a gene has the same mean regardless of the fitness of the present wild-type allele. Adaptation from new mutations is thus characterized by a kind of invariance: natural selection chooses from the same spectrum of beneficial effects at a locus independent of the fitness rank of the present wild type. I show that these findings are reasonably robust to deviations from several assumptions. I further show that one can back calculate the mean size of new beneficial mutations from the observed mean size of fixed beneficial mutations.},

title = {Insights into recombination from patterns of linkage disequilibrium in humans},
abstract = {An ability to predict levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between linked markers would facilitate the design of association studies and help to distinguish between evolutionary models. Unfortunately, levels of LD depend crucially on the rate of recombination, a parameter that is difficult to measure. In humans, rates of genetic exchange between markers megabases apart can be estimated from a comparison of genetic and physical maps; these large-scale estimates can then be interpolated to predict LD at smaller ("local") scales. However, if there is extensive small-scale heterogeneity, as has been recently proposed, local rates of recombination could differ substantially from those averaged over much larger distances. We test this hypothesis by estimating local recombination rates indirectly from patterns of LD in 84 genomic regions surveyed by the SeattleSNPs project in a sample of individuals of European descent and of African-Americans. We find that LD-based estimates are significantly positively correlated with map-based estimates. This implies that large-scale, average rates are informative about local rates of recombination. Conversely, although LD-based estimates are based on a number of simplifying assumptions, it appears that they capture considerable information about the underlying recombination rate or at least about the ordering of regions by recombination rate. Using LD-based estimators, we also find evidence for homologous gene conversion in patterns of polymorphism. However, as we demonstrate by simulation, inferences about gene conversion are unreliable, even with extensive data from homogeneous regions of the genome, and are confounded by genotyping error.},

In addition, two naturally occurring signaling systems, the p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase pathways in Xenopus oocytes, have been shown to exhibit bistable responses. Here we review the basic properties of bistable circuits, the requirements for construction of a satisfactory bistable switch, and the recent progress towards constructing and analysing bistable signaling systems.},

title = {On the conservative nature of intragenic recombination},
abstract = {Intragenic recombination rapidly creates protein sequence diversity compared with random mutation, but little is known about the relative effects of recombination and mutation on protein function. Here, we compare recombination of the distantly related beta-lactamases PSE-4 and TEM-1 to mutation of PSE-4. We show that, among beta-lactamase variants containing the same number of amino acid substitutions, variants created by recombination retain function with a significantly higher probability than those generated by random mutagenesis. We present a simple model that accurately captures the differing effects of mutation and recombination in real and simulated proteins with only four parameters: (i) the amino acid sequence distance between parents, (ii) the number of substitutions, (iii) the average probability that random substitutions will preserve function, and (iv) the average probability that substitutions generated by recombination will preserve function. Our results expose a fundamental functional enrichment in regions of protein sequence space accessible by recombination and provide a framework for evaluating whether the relative rates of mutation and recombination observed in nature reflect the underlying imbalance in their effects on protein function.},

abstract = {The effect of inbreeding and outbreeding depression on the evolution of assortment are often considered separately. For instance, inbreeding depression is usually thought to shape selfing rates whereas outbreeding depression is commonly thought to affect the evolution of assortative mating. In this article, we consider the evolution of assortment in a context of local adaptation and we show that it is a typical situation in which both effects act simultaneously to shape the degree of selfing or assortative mating. More specifically, we show that selection on a modifier of mating can be partitioned into three distinct effects: a transmission advantage, an association to heterozygosity (proportional to inbreeding depression), and an association to beneficial alleles (proportional to outbreeding depression), so that random mating may evolve even with strong local adaptation. In addition, we show that it is necessary to carefully delimit the conditions for polymorphism at local adaptation locus to study the evolution of assortment. In particular, the range of parameters most favorable to the maintenance of polymorphism corresponds to situations favoring less assortment.},

title = {SEX LINKAGE, SEX-SPECIFIC SELECTION, AND THE ROLE OF RECOMBINATION IN THE EVOLUTION OF SEXUALLY DIMORPHIC GENE EXPRESSION},
abstract = {Sex-biased genes - genes that are differentially expressed within males and females - are nonrandomly distributed across animal genomes, with sex chromosomes and autosomes often carrying markedly different concentrations of male- and female-biased genes. These linkage patterns are often gene- and lineage-dependent, differing between functional genetic categories and between species. While sex-specific selection is often hypothesized to shape the evolution of sex-linked and autosomal gene content, population genetics theory has yet to account for many of the gene- and lineage-specific idiosyncrasies emerging from the empirical literature. With the goal of improving the connection between evolutionary theory and a rapidly growing body of genome-wide empirical studies, we extend previous population genetics theory of sex-specific selection by developing and analyzing a biologically informed model that incorporates sex linkage, pleiotropy, recombination, and epistasis, factors that are likely to vary between genes and between species. Our results demonstrate that sex-specific selection and sex-specific recombination rates can generate, and are compatible with, the gene- and species-specific linkage patterns reported in the genomics literature. The theory suggests that sexual selection may strongly influence the architectures of animal genomes, as well as the chromosomal distribution of fixed substitutions underlying sexually dimorphic traits.},

Each gene had several variable SNPs and haplotypes that were present in all populations, as well as a number that were population-specific. Pairs of SNPs exhibited variability in the degree of linkage disequilibrium that was a function of their location within a gene, distance from each other, population distribution, and population frequency. Haplotypes generally had more information content (heterozygosity) than did individual SNPs. Our analysis of the pattern of variation strongly supports the recent expansion of the human population.},

abstract = {How gene duplication and divergence contribute to genetic novelty and adaptation has been of intense interest, but experimental evidence has been limited. The genetic switch controlling the yeast galactose use pathway includes two paralogous genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that encode a co-inducer (GAL3) and a galactokinase (GAL1). These paralogues arose from a single bifunctional ancestral gene as is still present in Kluyveromyces lactis. To determine which evolutionary processes shaped the evolution of the two paralogues, here we assess the effects of precise replacement of coding and non-coding sequences on organismal fitness. We suggest that duplication of the ancestral bifunctional gene allowed for the resolution of an adaptive conflict between the transcriptional regulation of the two gene functions. After duplication, previously disfavoured binding site configurations evolved that divided the regulation of the ancestral gene into two specialized genes, one of which ultimately became one of the most tightly regulated genes in the genome.},

title = {Pairwise and higher-order correlations among drug-resistance mutations in HIV-1 subtype B protease},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The reaction of HIV protease to inhibitor therapy is characterized by the emergence of complex mutational patterns which confer drug resistance. The response of HIV protease to drugs often involves both primary mutations that directly inhibit the action of the drug, and a host of accessory resistance mutations that may occur far from the active site but may contribute to restoring the fitness or stability of the enzyme. Here we develop a probabilistic approach based on connected information that allows us to study residue, pair level and higher-order correlations within the same framework. RESULTS: We apply our methodology to a database of approximately 13,000 sequences which have been annotated by the treatment history of the patients from which the samples were obtained. We show that including pair interactions is essential for agreement with the mutational data, since neglect of these interactions results in order-of-magnitude errors in the probabilities of the simultaneous occurence of many mutations. The magnitude of these pair correlations changes dramatically between sequences obtained from patients that were or were not exposed to drugs. Higher-order effects make a contribution of as much as 10% for residues taken three at a time, but increase to more than twice that for 10 to 15-residue groups. The sequence data is insufficient to determine the higher-order effects for larger groups. We find that higher-order interactions have a significant effect on the predicted frequencies of sequences with large numbers of mutations. While relatively rare, such sequences are more prevalent after multi-drug therapy. The relative importance of these higher-order interactions increases with the number of drugs the patient had been exposed to. CONCLUSION: Correlations are critical for the understanding of mutation patterns in HIV protease. Pair interactions have substantial qualitative effects, while higher-order interactions are individually smaller but may have a collective effect. Together they lead to correlations which could have an important impact on the dynamics of the evolution of cross-resistance, by allowing the virus to pass through otherwise unlikely mutational states. These findings also indicate that pairwise and possibly higher-order effects should be included in the models of protein evolution, instead of assuming that all residues mutate independently of one another.},

abstract = {Although there is increasing evidence that eukaryotic gene order is not always random, there is no evidence that putatively favourable gene arrangements are preserved by selection more than expected by chance. In yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), for example, co-expressed genes tend to be linked, but whether such gene pairs tend to remain linked more often than expected under null neutral expectations is not known. We show using gene pairs in the S. cerevisiae-Candida albicans comparison that highly co-expressed gene pairs are conserved as pairs at about twice the average rate. However, co-expressed genes also tend to be in close physical proximity and, as expected from a null neutral model, genes (be they co-expressed or not) that are physically close together tend to be retained more often. This physical proximity, however, only accounts for a small proportion of the enhanced degree of conservation of co-expressed gene pairs. These results demonstrate that purely neutralist models of gene order evolution are not realistic.},

Starting with a set of non-interacting proteins, we evolve a signal transduction network by random mutation and selection to fulfill a complex biological task. In order to validate this approach we base selection on a fitness function that captures the essential features of chemotactic behavior as seen in bacteria. We find that a system of as few as three proteins can evolve into a network mediating chemotaxis-like behavior by acting as a "derivative sensor". Furthermore, we find that the dynamics and topology of such networks show many similarities to the natural chemotaxis pathway, that the response magnitude can increase with increasing network size and that network behavior shows robustness towards variations in some of the internal parameters. We conclude that simulating the evolution of signal transduction networks to mediate a certain behavior may be a promising approach for understanding the general properties of the natural pathway for that behavior.},

title = {Genetic and statistical analyses of strong selection on polygenic traits: what, me normal?},
abstract = {We develop a general population genetic framework for analyzing selection on many loci, and apply it to strong truncation and disruptive selection on an additive polygenic trait. We first present statistical methods for analyzing the infinitesimal model, in which offspring breeding values are normally distributed around the mean of the parents, with fixed variance. These show that the usual assumption of a Gaussian distribution of breeding values in the population gives remarkably accurate predictions for the mean and the variance, even when disruptive selection generates substantial deviations from normality. We then set out a general genetic analysis of selection and recombination. The population is represented by multilocus cumulants describing the distribution of haploid genotypes, and selection is described by the relation between mean fitness and these cumulants. We provide exact recursions in terms of generating functions for the effects of selection on non-central moments. The effects of recombination are simply calculated as a weighted sum over all the permutations produced by meiosis. Finally, the new cumulants that describe the next generation are computed from the non-central moments. Although this scheme is applied here in detail only to selection on an additive trait, it is quite general. For arbitrary epistasis and linkage, we describe a consistent infinitesimal limit in which the short-term selection response is dominated by infinitesimal allele frequency changes and linkage disequilibria. Numerical multilocus results show that the standard Gaussian approximation gives accurate predictions for the dynamics of the mean and genetic variance in this limit. Even with intense truncation selection, linkage disequilibria of order three and higher never cause much deviation from normality. Thus, the empirical deviations frequently found between predicted and observed responses to artificial selection are not caused by linkage-disequilibrium-induced departures from normality. Disruptive selection can generate substantial four-way disequilibria, and hence kurtosis; but even then, the Gaussian assumption predicts the variance accurately. In contrast to the apparent simplicity of the infinitesimal limit, data suggest that changes in genetic variance after 10 or more generations of selection are likely to be dominated by allele frequency dynamics that depend on genetic details.},

title = {Selection in context: patterns of natural selection in the glycoprotein 120 region of human immunodeficiency virus 1 within infected individuals},
abstract = {Evolution of the HIV-1 V3 loop was monitored in 15 subjects over a period of 5 years at approximately 6-month intervals. Putative recombination was detected in many of the sequences. Evolutionary trees were estimated from the nonrecombinant viral sequences found in each individual. Selection and altered demographic regimes were detected with logit and other contingency analyses in a highly context-dependent fashion. Mutations leading to amino acid substitutions are subject to positive selection over a broad range of clinical conditions in the nonsyncytium-inducing (NSI) form, and the growth rates of the NSI strains and their level of genetic subdivision change little in going from a healthy immune system to a severely compromised immune system. In contrast, the SI form has a significant increase in growth rate as the immune system goes from healthy to compromised, particularly in those subjects who did not receive any antiviral drug therapy. This increase in SI growth rate results in a significant growth advantage of SI over NSI when the immune system is compromised. The SI strains also show more demographic subdivision when the immune system is healthy than when the immune system is compromised, and the SI form has greater demographic subdivision than NSI in subjects with healthy immune systems who also are not receiving antiviral drug therapy. Positive selection on amino-acid-changing mutations weakens and then intensifies again in the SI strains in going from healthy to compromised immune systems. These patterns are consistent with other studies that suggest that NSI strains inhibit replication of SI strains, that the V3 loop is more hidden from the immune system in the NSI form, that evolution in the V3 loop influences cell tropism and coreceptor usage, that substrate for replication of SI forms increases as the disease progresses, and that death of CD8 cells is influenced by the type of coreceptor usage typically found in SI but not in NSI strains. Finally, the transition between NSI and SI forms is associated with a burst of evolutionary change due to strong positive selection at sites other than those that define the NSI/SI phenotypes.},

title = {Pervasive natural selection in the Drosophila genome?},
abstract = {Over the past four decades, the predominant view of molecular evolution saw little connection between natural selection and genome evolution, assuming that the functionally constrained fraction of the genome is relatively small and that adaptation is sufficiently infrequent to play little role in shaping patterns of variation within and even between species. Recent evidence from Drosophila, reviewed here, suggests that this view may be invalid. Analyses of genetic variation within and between species reveal that much of the Drosophila genome is under purifying selection, and thus of functional importance, and that a large fraction of coding and noncoding differences between species are adaptive. The findings further indicate that, in Drosophila, adaptations may be both common and strong enough that the fate of neutral mutations depends on their chance linkage to adaptive mutations as much as on the vagaries of genetic drift. The emerging evidence has implications for a wide variety of fields, from conservation genetics to bioinformatics, and presents challenges to modelers and experimentalists alike.},

abstract = {The spread of HIV between immune cells is greatly enhanced by cell-cell adhesions called virological synapses, although the underlying mechanisms have been unclear. With use of an infectious, fluorescent clone of HIV, we tracked the movement of Gag in live CD4 T cells and captured the direct translocation of HIV across the virological synapse. Quantitative, high-speed three-dimensional (3D) video microscopy revealed the rapid formation of micrometer-sized "buttons" containing oligomerized viral Gag protein. Electron microscopy showed that these buttons were packed with budding viral crescents. Viral transfer events were observed to form virus-laden internal compartments within target cells. Continuous time-lapse monitoring showed preferential infection through synapses. Thus, HIV dissemination may be enhanced by virological synapse-mediated cell adhesion coupled to viral endocytosis.},

abstract = {Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are critical for the control of human immunodeficiency virus, but containment of virus replication can be undermined by mutations in CTL epitopes that lead to virus escape. We analyzed the evolution in vivo of an immunodominant, HLA-A2-restricted CTL epitope and found two principal, diametrically opposed evolutionary pathways that exclusively affect T cell-receptor contact residues. One pathway was characterized by acquisition of CTL escape mutations and the other by selection for wild-type amino acids. The pattern of CTL responses to epitope variants shaped which variant(s) prevailed in the virus population. The pathways notably influenced the amount of plasma virus, as patients with efficient CTL selection had lower plasma viral loads than did patients without efficient selection. Thus, viral escape from CTL responses does not necessarily correlate with disease progression.},

title = {The evolution of combinatorial gene regulation in fungi},
abstract = {It is widely suspected that gene regulatory networks are highly plastic. The rapid turnover of transcription factor binding sites has been predicted on theoretical grounds and has been experimentally demonstrated in closely related species. We combined experimental approaches with comparative genomics to focus on the role of combinatorial control in the evolution of a large transcriptional circuit in the fungal lineage. Our study centers on Mcm1, a transcriptional regulator that, in combination with five cofactors, binds roughly 4% of the genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and regulates processes ranging from the cell-cycle to mating. In Kluyveromyces lactis and Candida albicans, two other hemiascomycetes, we find that the Mcm1 combinatorial circuits are substantially different. This massive rewiring of the Mcm1 circuitry has involved both substantial gain and loss of targets in ancient combinatorial circuits as well as the formation of new combinatorial interactions. We have dissected the gains and losses on the global level into subsets of functionally and temporally related changes. One particularly dramatic change is the acquisition of Mcm1 binding sites in close proximity to Rap1 binding sites at 70 ribosomal protein genes in the K. lactis lineage. Another intriguing and very recent gain occurs in the C. albicans lineage, where Mcm1 is found to bind in combination with the regulator Wor1 at many genes that function in processes associated with adaptation to the human host, including the white-opaque epigenetic switch. The large turnover of Mcm1 binding sites and the evolution of new Mcm1-cofactor interactions illuminate in sharp detail the rapid evolution of combinatorial transcription networks.},

title = {The long coming of computational structural biology},
abstract = {Fifty years ago, the structures of the alpha-helix, the beta-sheet, the alpha-helical coiled coil and the collagen triple helix raised the expectation that protein structure could be understood computationally, using a combination of geometric considerations, model-building and parametric equations. The first crystal structures dispelled this hope, revealing a disconcerting lack of regularity in the folding patterns of proteins. Gradually it became clear that the protein folding problem-namely deducing the structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence-was of exceptional difficulty. Its solution has remained outside our reach to this day and, arguably, it represents the most important unsolved problem in molecular biology. Nevertheless, our ability to understand and predict molecular structure by computational means has made steady progress, suggesting that we will eventually conquer the problem, not by a few heroic insights, but by steady advances in biophysical knowledge, biological databases, software applications and raw computer power. Computational structural biology, whose influence is already pervasive, will come to dominate structural approaches in the next decades.},
